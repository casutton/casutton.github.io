![Charles Sutton](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/images/charles3.jpg){: .biopic}

Welcome! I am a research scientist at Google. I work in machine learning,
focusing on how to apply deep learning to computer programs and software engineering.
On this blog I write most about how to be a good researcher: how to do good work,
and how to have a good life at the same time.

I don't know if I would say --- except when I am applying
for a job, a grant, or an award --- that I have done research that is 
actually any good. I've written about [how I keep working through self-doubt](https://www.theexclusive.org/2018/09/impostor.html).

What I have done is I've seen research from different angles.
I've been a professor at [the University of Edinburgh](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk)
(more specifically, I was a [reader/associate professor]({% post_url 2013-08-17-academic-ranks-in-us-and-uk %}))
for eight years.
Before that, I was a postdoc at UC Berkeley and I did my PhD at UMass Amherst.

So I've worked with many brilliant people, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about what
they do right, and what I can do better. This has led me to write
about [how to cope with stress](/tag/advice),
[how to be creative]({% post_url 2017-06-06-brain-go %}),
and [staying focused when multitasking]({% post_url 2017-07-01-context-switching %}).

If you want to read my research, instead of how to do research,
then please see [my professional web page](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/).

## Contact me

The best way to contact me (insofar as any way is good; my response time
is longer than I might like) is [by email](mailto:csutton@inf.ed.ac.uk).

## Colophon

I made this [using Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). See [the source on Github](https://github.com/casutton/casutton.github.io).
