![Charles Sutton](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/images/charles3.jpg){: .biopic}

Welcome. I'm an academic researcher (currently 
a [reader/associate professor](/2013/08/academic-ranks-in-us-and-uk.html)) in machine learning.
If you like to learn more about my research,
please see [my professional web page](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/).

I write here about aspects of academic life that
aren't my research. I try to write as an essayist,
to attempt to figure things out, how the University
works, how to be a better researcher, how to give 
better advice to students.
Well, except when,
sometimes, I write [just to be silly](/tags/silly).

## Contact me

The best way to contact me (insofar as any way is good; my response time
is longer than I might like) is [by email](mailto:csutton@inf.ed.ac.uk).
