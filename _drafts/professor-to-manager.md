Sometimes the PhD degree is criticized as narrow. The criticism goes:
The PhD trains students to be professors, but most students do not become professors.
True as far as it goes, but I'd go further.
The PhD doesn’t train you to be a professor, either! 

The PhD trains you to *do* research, but not to *manage* research.

In computer science, and in many sciences, a professor is a research manager.
Managing research is a different enterprise than other types of managing.

Vincent Vanhoucke has written an excellent [article
on how to manage research teams](https://vanhoucke.medium.com/managing-research-teams-part-ii-acd4443586e5).
It is an amazing and wise article, and I recommend you read it.


I won't discuss it though, because I think that a lot of professors
pick up the skills in that article. I want to talk about some more
tactical skills that we're not taught.

The culture around feedback is more explicit.




Cite the thing that Martin likes point — extremely laissez faire 

What have I learned about being a professor from being a research manager in industry?

Big tech are conscious about the
* giving feedback
* providing advice
* looking “behind” and “around” what the person says 

Think consciously about where they are in the careers

Encourage reflection

Cheerleading is important

Directness is important. When I was a professor, I was very very sparing with c

I was also very conscious that I would never tell someone whether I thought they could meet their career goals. This is because of the quantum dynamics of PhD students. Most of the time, you can predict the level of success == but not 100% grades.
Grades are very poor predictors.
