A nice way to end this series would be to talk about [impostor syndrome](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1973),
but I'm the wrong
person to write that blog, because I don't think that I've ever literally
felt like an impostor. My self-doubt comes out in a different way.

To explain, let me get a bit more personal. An important warning.
If you are currently serving on a committee that is considering whether to offer
me a new job, promotion, prize, or award, please can you stop reading now. Thank you.

Even in my lowest moments, I'm not worried that I'll be discovered and
exposed as a fraud. My feelings of inadequacy come out in a different, simpler
way. I'm simply convinced that I'm not good enough.
Not good enough for what? you ask. Anything, really.

Don't worry about me. Please do not try to talk me up, tell me that
I'm being too self-critical, and that I really am a fine researcher, and
by the way you have always liked my papers.
Actually I'll take the last part back: You're more than welcome to
write to me about how much you like my papers.
Flattery will get you nowhere, but it might make me feel better.


What I've decided to do is simply to accept that I am inadequate, embrace the fact that I am not good enough, and learn how to find joy in research anyway.

But it's not my probem that I'm not good enough it's my employers'.

I can learn things and I can help my students, collaborators, etc. I'm not sure why I seem to be able to help them, because they're really smart, but as long the conversations seem to help them, I'm enjoying them, so I'll

Maybe my students are just being polite, or worried that if they let me know how useless I really am, that I won't write them a good letter of recommendation. But come on, my students are computer scientists, I'm pretty sure that they lack the social skills to deceive me.

And as long as I have an outside chance to do something that really is good enough, I'm going to try.

As long as I can still enjoy talking to people about new ideas

As long as I can still read new papers that come out, understand their potential impact, and see opportunities to improve them

As long as I can still see new directions that others aren't yet pushing on

This is a similar idea to the seven year postdoc.

Even if I reach the end of my career, and never do something that ever fully meets my expectaions, I've been part of a research conversation that has had an impact on society. I've trained people who have gone on to good careers. I've been part of the life of the university. That's enough to make my life worthwhile, even after all the papers that I've writen have faded into oblivion.
