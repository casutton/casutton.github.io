  <h1>Know thyself. The New Year's resolution that underlies all productivity advice</h1>

  <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on January  5, 2019

  <div class="content">
  <p>I’m a sucker for New Year’s resolutions.
Every year I make up a half dozen resolutions,
usually the same ones each year, and carefully track
my progress for at least two or three months
before I get busy and forget all about them.
And in all seriousness, I’m happy about this, because
sometimes, for maybe one resolution in four,
I’m still able to make a lasting
change in my habits. That’s more than enough
to justify the effort,
as long as I take the failures in good humor.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be as silly about resolutions as I am,
or even to have any resolutions at all, but the underlying
principle is important for any creative work.
You could say that it’s the underlying principle
behind all of the advice in this blog.</p>

<p>You need to know yourself, understand the way you think,
adapt the way you work to the way you think,
and always keep looking for ways to work better.</p>

<p>You will have all kinds of little
preferences about when you are most alert, creative,
and productive. Maybe you like to work in the morning.
Maybe you like to have a bit of background noise,
like in a coffee shop. Maybe you need almost absolute
quiet. Maybe you like to work from home, or maybe
you prefer the structure of having an office,
where your work space is separate from home.
Maybe you like to pace around the office,
talking to yourself and gesticulating wildly.
Or maybe that’s just me. Ahem.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, you need to learn what makes
you think most effectively, and seek out that environment.
No one can do that for you. Your best work space
will be different
for you than it is for me. (And good thing, too, otherwise
  all of Google would be people bumping into each other
  in the hallways
  because they were too busy talking to themselves.)
The only way to know is to experiment and find out what
works for you.</p>

<p>And it’s also vital for us to keep experimenting,
no matter how senior we are in our careers.
One reason is (I think this is from David Allen),
“The better you get, the better you’d <em>better</em> get.”
As you become more accomplished, you gain a reputation
which means that more demands are placed on you.
Another reason is that no matter how good you are,
you haven’t learned all of the tricks.
Your mental rhythms change as you get older,
just as an athlete in his thirties trains differently
than a teenager. Finally, the creative challenges change
as you get later in your career, as you need to learn to
adapt to the way that the field has changed in twenty years.</p>

<p>What’s always appealed to me about the research
career is that you never stop learning.
This is as much true for how you set up
the environment of your work as it is for the
content of your work.</p>
