  <h1>A Suggestion for Scotland</h1>

  <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on February 28, 2014

  <div class="content">
  <p>This will be a big year for the United Kingdom. In September, Scotland will hold a referendum to decide whether to remain in the UK or to become an independent country. For several years, support for independence has remained steady at around 33%, but <a href="http://whatscotlandthinks.org/topics/referendum-voting-intention">some polls have shown</a> that support for independence may be increasing. For my American friends, I personally think that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/07/scot-vote-yes-independence-scotland">this op-ed</a> is a good primer.</p>

<p>As a foreigner, I cannot vote in the referendum, and rightly so. But I would like to humbly propose a third option for Scotland, just as a suggestion. A middle ground between the risks of complete independence, and the current reality of being yoked to Westminster.</p>

<p>I suggest that come September, Scotland should secede from the United Kingdom and join the United States as the 51st state.</p>

<p>This would be welcomed all throughout the US, I guarantee it. <strong>Americans love Scotland.</strong> We really, really love Scotland, even if we can’t find it on a map. There are more people of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_American">Scottish ancestry in America</a> than there are in Scotland. We have <a href="http://www.vascottishgames.org">Scottish festivals</a> all over the country, with kilts, bagpipes, Highland dance — the whole works, except only for haggis (which is actually <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21128089">illegal to import</a>) and Irn Bru (that stuff’s minging). My point is, Americans really, really like Scotland. Maybe <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25856657">the EU would dither</a> about accepting an independent Scotland, but the US would accept Scotland in a New York minute.</p>

<p>Polls show that Scots are concerned about their economic future. <strong>Joining the US would be great for Scotland’s economy.</strong> By joining into a single trading area with the United States, it would be easier for American tourists to come to Scotland, and for Scottish haggis to come to the US (I love that stuff). Also, you need to consider the film industry. We spent $70 million making a movie about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112573/">the last time Scotland won independence</a>. Don’t think we won’t do it again. We put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Scott">a Scot into outer space</a>. Heck, we even made up <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472181/">a Scottish smurf</a>! The fact is, over the past 50 years, Hollywood has done more for Scotland than London has. Join with us, and we can do more, together.</p>

<p>Now, some might argue that my suggestion is impractical. After all, <strong>Scotland is a long way from the US</strong>. (Americans: you might need a map for this part.)  But with modern telecommunications, there’s no reason this should be an issue. In fact, Washington, DC, is actually 1000 miles <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=distance+washington+dc+to+edinburgh">closer to Edinburgh</a> than it is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=distance+washington+dc+to+honolulu+hi">to Honolulu</a>.</p>

<p>I can understand that <strong>some Scots might be concerned about this proposal</strong>. After all, Washington DC has been pretty dysfunctional lately. Some might ask: Are these really the people you want to join your political future with? First, it’s important to point out that the US Congress makes up only 0.000017% of the population. Most Americans are more sensible. Second, and most important, <strong>this is why we need your help</strong>. It’s true that there are a lot of perfectly nice people in the US whose political views are batshit crazy. But it’s also true that the country is deeply divided. The crazy people are really only about 49.8% of the population. Even though Scotland’s population is small, in a politically polarised country, it’s enough to tip the balance. Think about it: The US State of Scotland would probably receive 9 electoral votes. The US presidential election of 2000 was decided by only 5. Just think about the good that Scotland could have done for the entire world.</p>

<p>Clearly, this is one of the most difficult and important political issues in Scotland’s history. Honest people of good intentions will come to different opinions. But I hope that I’ve convinced you that this third option is one that’s worthy of serious consideration.</p>
