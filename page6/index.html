         <h1><a href="/2015/04/viva-la-voce.html">Viva la voce</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on April 11, 2015

         <div class="entry">
         <p>One of my favourite aspects of academia in the UK is the final oral examination for the PhD — formally called a <em>viva voce</em>, which everyone seems to call a <em>viva</em> (VEYE-vah). The viva is an oral examination that typically consists of the student and two examiners, one from within the University (the internal examiner), and one from outwith the university (the external examiner).</p>

<p>Both examiners read the thesis carefully, and ask the student detailed questions. The traditional way to do this is that all three have a paper copy of the thesis, and the examiners go through the thesis page by page with their questions. Some questions are high level (“Why did you choose technique X rather than technique Y?”) and some can be very detailed (“In your proof of Theorem 4.3 on page 176, I’m not sure that the third step is correct. What if the matrix A is non-singular?”).</p>

<p>This discussion commonly takes 2-3 hours. Longer and shorter vivas are not unheard of, though if you ask me, a one-hour viva is a bit of a rip-off for the student, and a five-hour viva isn’t kind, unless the length is caused by the student being exceptionally argumentative or loquacious.</p>

<p>At the end of the viva, the student is asked to wait outside, and the examiners decide whether the student should be awarded a PhD, and if so what corrections to the thesis are required. The most common outcome is a pass subject to minor corrections, which the student is allowed a few months to complete.</p>

<p>Essentially, in my experience a viva is a detailed technical discussion of the content of the thesis. Most students start out nervous, sometimes exceedingly so, but relax after a few questions as they realize that this is just a technical discussion of the sort that they have had many times before. That said, even if your research career is long, it is rare that a trusted colleague will provide you with several hours of detailed feedback on your work. To be part of a discussion like this, on either side of the table, is a privilege: most work is ignored, so any criticism is a compliment.</p>

<p>I am sure that the process is more tense if the examiners believe that the quality of the thesis is borderline — fortunately, I haven’t yet been asked to examine a thesis like that. If portions of your thesis have already been published in prestigious venues, and whether this is possible at all varies greatly across disciplines, then you can be fairly sure that your thesis is not near the borderline.</p>

<p>A colleague suggested to me once that a viva is like a negotiation. If your thesis represents a sufficient amount of research of acceptable quality (and if it was indeed you that wrote it), then you will pass. The negotiation is over which corrections will be required. Responsible examiners do not want to require additional experiments that will require months of work, if the thesis as submitted is of excellent quality. But they also don’t want a thesis to be passed with gaping holes in its argumentation. The purpose of the discussion is to sort out which potential concerns are which, and your voice in this discussion matters — you wrote the thesis, so you are the expert in the room.</p>

<p>Sometimes an examiner asks a question with an eye to a correction being required. Maybe you think, “yeah, that’s a good point, I should add a paragraph on that” — in this case, don’t hesitate to say so. On the other hand, if providing a good answer to the examiner’s question would require months of additional research, politely explain why, while also giving the best answer you can given what you do know. What you don’t want to do is argue every point strongly, even when the examiners are clearly right… that is not good negotiation strategy.</p>

<p>A bit more about who attends the viva. The internal examiner is <em>not</em> the supervisor, in fact, they will not have been involved with the thesis research at all. It is not unusual for the internal examiner to be a bit of generalist with respect to the thesis topic, although when I have served as internal, I have usually been able to make out the thesis reasonably well. Presumably this is because the School of Informatics is large enough that there are many theses in machine learning and natural language processing that need to be examined.</p>

<p>The external examiner is chosen specifically for their expertise in the subject matter, and to serve as an external is generally seen as a minor indicator of prestige. A certain amount of deference is paid to the external in the culture of the process. Even so, I have the sense that part of the role of the internal is to be accountable to the University (for following correct procedures) and to the student and the supervisor (to make sure that the examination is fair to the student). I have read and heard horror stories of aggressive external examiners but never witnessed one; to the contrary, the examiners who I have witnessed have all gone out of their way to be kind to the student.</p>

<p>The role of the supervisor in the viva, I think that this may vary slightly across institutions. At Edinburgh, the supervisor is allowed to attend the viva, if the student permits, but not to participate in any way. In my experience as internal examiner, the supervisor has attended about half the time. One supervisor silently took notes to share with the student, which I think is quite a kind thing to do.</p>

<p>Finally, although the description is written for a US audience, British academia also fetaures <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/faq-the-snake-fight-portion-of-your-thesis-defense">the snake fight portion of your viva</a>.</p>

<p>(Written in honour of my first PhD student graduating. Congratulations Yichuan!)</p>

         <div class="entry">
         <p>Due to a recent bout of jet lag,<sup><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> I have found myself this week waking up at 5am.
So I am experimenting with reading a paper first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>I am hoping that starting off the day with an intellectual task will help me to avoid
“administrator brain”, which <a href="http://science-professor.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/this-is-your-brain-on-administration.html">FSP describes in an excellent post</a>.</p>

<p>So far (well, two days in) it has been really fun. It helps me to stay motivated, because after writing 50 emails in a day, your mind gets lost in minutiae, and you forget that you came to this job to learn, to help people, and to be creative.</p>

<p>Can’t promise that I’ll keep waking up at 5am, though.</p>

    <p>I have begin scheduling posts well in advance, so this bout will no longer be recent when you read this. <a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></p>

         <h1><a href="/2014/12/taste-in-research-and-paradox-of.html">Taste in research, and the paradox of deciding what not to work on</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on December  6, 2014
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>A large part of taste in research is deciding what <em>not</em> to work on. You might choose not to apply method X, even though you don’t really understand it, because it has a reputation for being fiddly and difficult to get right. You might choose not to work on topic Y because you think that even though there’s a lot of people writing papers about it, its goals are too ambitious to ever be met. This extends all the way to entire fields of research. I could name a few popular fields within computer science — with active research communities, large amounts of external research funding, leading researchers with fancy prestigious awards — that I suspect are being investigated in entirely the wrong way, and that I personally think are currently pointless.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> name them. Will I? No.</p>

<p>Why not? To protect my career? If I am honest, probably in part yes. But what I tell myself is different. The real answer, I think, is that my opinion of these areas is poorly informed. Because I think these areas are uninteresting, I haven’t studied them carefully, and so I don’t know how they’ve attempted to address my naive objections. It would be arrogant and professionally irresponsible to publicly denigrate the hard work of many people without having even bothered to read it.</p>

<p>This leads to a paradox. It’s impossible <em>by definition</em> for me to become better informed about these areas, unless I decide to actually start researching them. In order to be fully confident that an area is uninteresting, you need to study it — and that study itself is part of doing research! But you can’t do careful reading on every research area that seems bogus at first impression, because then you would do nothing else. Instead, you have to take intellectual shortcuts, and do the best you can with limited time to think. Those research areas that smell a bit off, you ignore them until either they die out, or a major success forces you to reevaluate. Part of taste in research is deciding what to study, and what to ignore.</p>

<p>This is the paradox of taste in research. Your decision of what not to work on is, by definition, always ill-informed.</p>

         <div class="author">

         <div class="entry">
         <p>I walked home past several people setting off sparklers and fireworks in the meadows. In Edinburgh celebrations of Guy Fawkes night are not elaborate, but you can smell the gunpowder.</p>

<p>A good thing, because otherwise I can never remember what night it is. The traditional rhyme</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>     Remember, remember, the fifth of November</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is about the worst possible mnemonic that I could think of. It fits the meter just as well to say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>     Remember, remember, the FOURTH of November</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but you aren’t meant to remember that one. Personally I prefer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>     Remember, remember, the ninth of November,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because that happens also to be my birthday.</p>

<p>Much more sensible to base the rhyme on the part that’s easiest to confuse.
Instead, how about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let the memory survive
      That the king was still alive
          On November five.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you won’t forget.</p>

         <h1><a href="/2014/11/business-cards-and-me.html">Business Cards and Me</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on November  1, 2014
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>Just before I went to my first conference, I thought, “Hey, I guess I should be professional now!” and printed out business cards on the best card stock that I could find at Staples. Apparently, of the hundreds of people who attended NIPS that year, I was the only one who had done this. I handed out one card, received none, and assumed that everyone must just Google each other after the conference.</p>

<p>From an objective standpoint, from the perspective of maximizing the efficiency of scholarly communication, this is of course ridiculous. The only explanation that I can imagine is reverse snobbery, the same reason we would never wear a suit and tie to work. But at the time, I didn’t worry about this. I just did what everyone else did.</p>

<p>I’m eleven years older now, and my memory is much worse. At the last conference I attended, I thought, “Hey, wouldn’t it be great if next time, I could go home with a list of every new person that I met, perhaps on a durable but unobtrusive slip of paper?” I do worry about people giving me funny looks, but I can’t very well pretend to myself that I am creative and iconoclastic if I always do what my friends do.</p>

<p>So if I meet you at NIPS this year, do not be surprised if you receive an unobtrusive slip of paper from me. I hope that you enjoy the word cloud on the back.</p>

	   <p class="poem">
   A set o' dull, conceited hashes<br>
   Confuse their brains in college-classes!<br>
	   They gang in stirks, and come out asses<br>
	   Plain truth to speak; <br>
An' syne they think to climb Parnassus <br>
By dint o' Greek!
