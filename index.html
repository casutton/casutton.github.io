         <h1><a href="/2024/03/mafia.html">What I Observed about Research Networking from Joining the Mafia</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on March  3, 2024
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>I’ve written before about Joseph Pistone, an undercover FBI agent who tricked his way into joining the U.S. mafia in the 1970s,
and how <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Donnie-Brasco-Undercover-Joseph-Pistone/dp/0451192575">his account of the mafia</a> 
reminds me of my experience of doing research. Here’s another connection between the underworld and the research world.
Brasco tells this story about his boss, Sonny, who has just come back from a meeting with the big boss
of another organization (Trafficante).
Think of this like a middle manager meeting with a CEO of a different company.
This is what we read:</p>

<figure class="quote">
<blockquote>
In the car Sonny unwound. “It was a feeling-out conversation,” he says, “I told [Trafficante], ‘listen, I'm no sophisticated person. I'm a street person all my life.’ I says, ‘I love the streets, you know. I don't know nothing about nothing, about gambling or anything.’ I says, ‘Me, I just like to go in the street, rob who the f__k I gotta rob.’” -Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia
</blockquote>
</figure>

<p>What impressed me about this was that mobsters <em>have</em> feeling-out conversations.
If you want to be a career criminal, you can’t do it all on your own. You need to know other people
who can steal stuff along with you, buy the stuff you have stolen, fight people who are trying 
to cheat you.
The truth is — according to my reading, I don’t have first-hand experience! — that 
professional networking is absolutely vital if you want to make money in the mafia.</p>

<p>I could imagine the equivalent of this feeling-out conversation in the tech industry, or in academia.
We don’t go into the street and rob anybody, of course, we’d be laughably incompetent at that.
I could imagine a professor telling a new student, “Oh, I still like to write code once in a while,
it helps me stay grounded.” Or I think of advice for <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/staying-hands-on">tech managers about how to stay
technical</a>, you know, so they can “go in the street”.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this when I was starting a new collaboration, a while back.
You want to work together, you both talk about why you’re excited about the direction,
how it’s going to be great because we’re all bringing complementary skills to the table.
Maybe you mention how much you’ve enjoyed reading their work over the years.
Probably this is all true — you wouldn’t be considering the collaboration otherwise!
But from now on, every time this happens, I’m going to be thinking about those two
mafia guys in the 1970s, considering a new potential “collaboration” down in Florida.</p>

<p>(PS Oh about the title. The title, of course, refers to what I learned from <em>Joe Pistone</em> 
joining the Mafia. Not me!)</p>

         <h1><a href="/2023/01/joy.html">Joy in Research</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on January  1, 2023
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>It’s hard to remember what machine learning conferences were like in person, but I think that I liked them a lot better when the field was smaller. It was easier to meet new people, to talk about new ideas in small groups of talented people who were really excited by them. The culture of the field has changed from back then, in intellectual ways that you know already, but the social ways are worth reflecting on, too.</p>

<p>Romanticizing the past is a sorry hobby for old men. I will not do that. All research communities have a callous system at their core — I’ve written about the <a href="/2018/03/tournament-axe.html">toxic</a> <a href="/2018/04/worth.html">forces</a> that drive and derail research careers — that’s always been the case.</p>

<p>Maybe now, these forces have gotten stronger and worse: The field is so much larger, we don’t all know each other, and the rewards for success are greater than I would have thought possible twenty years ago. The incentive to be competitive rather than kind, to fight on social media rather than to learn from people you disagree with, to speak hype rather than forthright truth, is so hard to resist. The temptation, in a word, to career rather than to learn. And as loath as I am to admit it, I have changed, too. Probably in similar ways, and for similar reasons.</p>

<p>Of course I wouldn’t want to go back. The most exciting time to be in this field is right now. But maybe I would go back in time, if just to grab something and come back. What I would bring with me is joy. Joy in reading a paper with a cute new idea, and chatting about it with friends over lunch. The joy that would impel us to make up a stupid song or a silly skit about our research workshop, with the same spirit of play to work out a new kind of algorithm, which may seem silly at first.</p>

<p>Joy in learning, joy in sharing, and joy in trying things out.</p>

<p>Happy new year!</p>

         <h1><a href="/2020/05/virtual-iclr.html">ICLR 2020: My first virtual conference</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on May 10, 2020
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p><em>(or: How I learned to stop worrying and love virtual conferencing.)</em></p>

<p>Many computer science conferences are becoming virtual this year,
due to travel restrictions.
I enjoy physical conferences, so I was a bit skeptical
about virtual conferences, despite their necessity.
Since <a href="https://iclr.cc/virtual/index.html">ICLR 2020</a> was the first major machine learning
conference to be virtual,
this was a good chance to test my skepticism.
Here’s a personal report about the parts of the conference
that I had a chance to experience, how well they worked for me,
and what I would do differently the next time I attend
a virtual conference.</p>

<p>At the top, the bottom line:
ICLR was better than I expected a virtual conference could be.
Both the format and the <a href="https://github.com/iclR/iclr.github.io/">code</a> should be a model
for other computer science conferences that are going virtual.
Massive congratulations are in order for all of the organizers, 
including the chairs Sasha Rush, Shakir Mohamed,
Dawn Song, Kyunghyun Cho, and Martha White.
There’s still more work to be done to make virtual conferences great,
because we haven’t yet figured out serendipity, or
how to recreate
the fluid social dynamics of a large meeting.
But now we have a great starting point to experiment from.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it-who-was-there-what-happened">What is it? Who was there? What happened?</h2>

<p>The International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR) is one
of the largest machine learning research conference.
The physical ICLR 2019 conference has 2700 attendees.
This year, the conference accepted 687 research papers from 2594 submissions.</p>

<p>The organizers of ICLR put an incredible amount of effort
at short notice to build custom software to support the virtual conference
(their code is open source, see links at the end).
The <a href="https://medium.com/@iclr_conf/format-for-the-iclr2020-virtual-conference-76716ddea640">conference format</a>
featured prerecorded talks, live Q&amp;A sessions both for invited speakers,
and text chat rooms.
There were other parts of the conference where I didn’t spend much time:
I only spent a little time at the workshops, and I didn’t have a chance to
attend the virtual vendor booths or official conference socials. 
ICLR 2020 was big, even bigger than the in-person machine learning conferences:
over 5600 registrations, 1300+ speakers, one million page views, and 100k+ video watches.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-loved-about-virtual-iclr">What I loved about Virtual ICLR</h2>

<p>Suprisingly, <strong>I really loved the poster sessions.</strong> Every accepted research
paper was presented as a virtual poster. Every paper had a web page
that collected together links to the paper, the reviews (this is ICLR — they use openreview),
a five-minute video by the authors, a text chat room, and links to a Zoom
videoconference room specifically for the paper.</p>

<p>Every day of the conference had five 2-hour poster sessions, spread out to be convenient for
participants from different time zones. Of course, the videos were always available,
but each paper was assigned to two different poster session at which the authors could attend
the Zoom room and answer questions. Assigning each paper to two sessions was designed
to increase the number of time zones that were conventient for each poster.</p>

<p>The five-minute videos were my favorite part of the conference.
They were synchronzied to slides, so if the talk was covering background you already knew,
or if you missed a point, you could click back and forth in the slides.
(In person, this is harder to do, and depends on the social and language skills of both participants.)
I found the videos were a great way to get an overview of many papers and decide
where I wanted to focus my time. They were much more polished and a little more in
depth than the elevator pitch that you get at a physical poster when you ask,
“Could you tell me a bit about this work?”</p>

<p>The Zoom rooms themselves were sparsely attended. I hopped into the rooms 
for probably a dozen papers, and usually I was the only one there, apart from the authors.
Perhaps twice there was one person already asking a question. 
For me, this was great, because then I could start a ncie conversation with the authors
(some tips on that later). 
The downside is I have learned a lot from hearing questions that my colleagues
have asked at posters — that didn’t happen here.</p>

<p>The text chat rooms for each paper were active. People would ask detailed technical
questions and the authors would respond. Some of the discussions were fairly in depth.</p>

<p>One way that virtual posters are arguably better than physical:
<em>you could not see who else was looking at the poster</em>.
Indeed, even though the Zoom rooms were generally quiet, the posters got a fair amount of attention.
The median poster had 200 unique views, and the most popular had over 1000.
Machine learning is a trend-seeking community, for as long as I’ve been a part of it.
At physical conferences, posters from famous authors and research labs become very crowded,
so much so that they become short talks (a poster session of repeated loops,
like in Westworld) rather than scientific discussions. Hiding poster popularity prevented the bad aspects
of the rich-get-richer dynamics.</p>

<p>Each poster session had its own page that listed the title and author
of each paper (but no institutions, again to prevent rich-get-richer) along with an automatically
generated thumbnail. These were randomly ordered for fairness.</p>

<p>The <strong>invited talks worked well</strong> also. These were prerecorded longer talks with
a live Q&amp;A. If I remember right, the video of the talks were made available
the day before the Q&amp;A. This worked well because what you get out of an invited talk,
you can get just as much from a recording, and the live Q&amp;As were very active.
In some cases, speakers stayed for over an hour answering questions over
both audio and text chat.</p>

<p>The <strong>overall paper visualization</strong> was well done. This plotted all of the papers as
points in 2D space, organized by topic. You could highlight papers by keyword, authoor,
and so on. These 2D visualizations are often a mess
(I even have <a href="https://xuk.ai/darksight/">a paper discussing that</a>), but this one seemed to locate papers
together sensibly. I took some pride in that one of my papers was an outlier at the edge of the display.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-vs-physical">Virtual vs Physical?</h2>

<p>For me, there are two points to coming to a conference:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Networking. Meeting new people who I can learn from, and learning new things
from old colleagues.</li>
  <li>Broadening my view. I can attend a lot of posters and talks to get a broad snapshot
of subareas that I might not have time to follow in detail when arxiv preprints come out.
The curation function that a conference serves, as problematic as it is, really helps me here.</li>
</ol>

<p>These worked differently at a virtual conference. For broadening my view, the virtual
conference was actually better, because the five minute videos were overall nicer 
than the quick explanation that you might get at a physical poster.</p>

<p>For networking, as you would expect, my experience was more mixed. 
On the good side, it was easier to meet the poster presenters, because others were Zoom-shy.
This was great for meeting PhD students. In a lot of ways, though,
<strong>I found networking harder at a virtual conference</strong>. Here is what was harder to make happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was hard to connect with old colleagues, because I didn’t know who was participating
in the virtual event when.</li>
  <li>I had fewer serendipitous meetings. I can’t count the number of research meetings
that have started impromptu at local coffeeshops near the conference.
Sometimes I will start talking to someone I don’t know well, only to find
that there is an unexpected connection
between our different research interests. This can result in collaborations,
invited talks, grant proposals…</li>
  <li>Networking cascades. <a href="https://www.theexclusive.org/2015/05/my-top-conference-attendance-tip.html">When you meet one person, they might introduce you to others.</a>
This can happen naturally, like when you are talking to someone and one of their colleagues
invites them to lunch. This is harder in a virtual format.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advice-for-participants-how-to-virtual-conference-with-aplomb">Advice for participants: How to virtual-conference with aplomb</h2>

<p>Attending a virtual conference is a different skill from attending a physical one.
Here are some things that I will try to do better next time:
For participants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As much as you can, clear your calendar. Treat the virtual conference as reserved time.
You say, “That’s hard for me.” I know. It was hard for me too. But if you can reserve
time to attend a physcial conference, you can do it for a virtual conference.
Really, no one will stop you.</li>
  <li>Preparation helps. For physical conferences, I always have the best intentions to read lots
of papers on the plane, but it doesn’t always happen. For virtual conferences, I think that
preparation is more important because the face-to-face time (Zoom rooms etc) is even more limited.
I wish that I had watched more of the five minute videos in advance of the poster sessions.
I think it’s also good to be proactive about setting up individual meetings before the conference.</li>
  <li>How not to be shy during poster sessions. I have the impressions that many attendees
were reluctant to participate in the poster sessions because it felt a bit socially awkward,
and hard to have a good question.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have some <strong>advice for asking virtual poster questions</strong> (this is an advice blog, after all).
First, embrace the awkwardness. Yeah, it is a bit awkward at first, but once you
start talking, it’s just another technical conversation like many you’ve had before.
Second, yeah, you do need a question, but it doesn’t need to be brilliant,
and you don’t need to have read the paper. “I watched the video, but I didn’t
understand how the Thagomizer works. Could you tell me a bit more about that?”
“Is your regularization scheme related to curriculum learning?”
“I’m really interested in your work, because my recent work is about machine learning
for baking sourdough. Do you think that your work could be applied to that?”
It’s that easy to start a conversation!</p>

<h2 id="what-more-could-we-do-next-time">What more could we do next time?</h2>

<p>I take away two big positive lessons from virtual ICLR: poster sessions
can work virtually, and text chat helps a lot.
How can we do even better? How do we get more serendipity and networking
in a virtual conferences?</p>

<p>To support social networking, 
there is lots of room to <strong>experiment with using videoconferencing creatively</strong>.
Perhaps we could see lists of who
is around the virtual conference at any one time (allowing people to explore anonymously if they prefer.)
Perhaps we can have low friction ways to create a one-off videoconferencing rooms,
which others can see and join. Maybe we could consider having “virtual receptions”:
a one-hour block of time where many people are present to have discussions,
and people can show up and self-organize videoconference discussions of even 3 or 4 people.
I sometimes joke that perhaps we could virtually replicate running into someone
in the hallway: 10% of the time, when you attempt to join the videoconference
room for a poster, you are redirected to a videoconference with a random participant instead.
That’s a bit silly, but random chat groups, perhaps in larger groups, and with safegards 
to prevent abuse, might feasible. Perhaps we will find creative ways to use social
media during a virtual conference.</p>

<p>A great example of creative videoconferencing was ICLRTown: a 2D virtul world <em>cum</em> videoconferencing system.
You moved a little 2D avatar around an 80s style graphic of a conference center.
When you get close enough to someone else’s sprite, you see their video
and can talk to them. We got chats of up to 9 people that way.
This was fun to play with, but it still seems a work in progress.</p>

<p>Finally, I wonder to what extent the huge scale of ICLR actually <em>helped</em> it to be a
virtual conference, making it easier to spread across timezones, or easier to get
a critical mass for live Q&amp;A. Most computer sciences conferences are smaller
than ICLR, so different models might work well for them.</p>

         <h1><a href="/2020/02/how-to-begin-in-machine-learning.html">How do you break into a career in machine learning?</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on February  1, 2020
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>I got a question the other day about how to start a career in machine learning.
I gave the best answer that I could, but I’m not sure that my best was
very good. Can you help? If so, join the discussion on social media
(or send me a note privately):</p>

<p>The question was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am currently studying for a master’s at [a good university outside
the United States <em>-cas</em>] while working part-time as an NLP research engineer. I would like to ask you for some advice if that was possible.</p>

  <p>My question is: without having outstanding grades or publications in top AI journals, how could I find my way towards a top Ph.D. program or at least research internship, is there any possibility? I am currently working on deep learning (paid job) and have some Ph.D. offers. Still, I feel that internships at companies like Google or Ph.D. positions at top research centers are impossible without previous experience in a similar place, which is like a snake biting its tail. Except for students with massive GPA scores, which is not my case.</p>

  <p>I am happy with my current job, but so far, I have just been able to grasp the opportunities that I found, so I am thinking about trying to go abroad. Everything I have found is very applied, and I would like to study more abstract or generic (even exotic) topics, instead of applying existing neural architectures to specific domains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote:</p>

<p>Lots and lots of applicants to computer science PhD programs want to do machine learning, so admissions is very competitive. I don’t think it’s necessary to have publications to get into a PhD program, although it does help, and the higher you go in the rankings, the more that you need any help that you can get.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that I have better advice than to learn as much as you can, do good work, network with others, and work your way up the prestige ladder. 
It’s true that going to a very highly ranked school gives you an advantage, but I know very good researchers who did not have very good grades in undergrad, and even if you do your PhD at a lower ranked place, if your work is good, it still can stand out.</p>

<p>And now, a question for my readers (all three of them),
what do you think?</p>

in this blog.</p>

<p>It goes without saying, however, that
you should not model your own career
on the characters in the PhD comics strip.
For one thing, they’ve been in grad school
for more than 20 years.</p>

<p>Amazingly, though, there are three PhD comic strips,
and probably only three,
that are actually good research advice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=715">Writing your thesis outline.</a>
A thesis is daunting. How do you write an entire
book over five-plus years? Instead, I like to tell my students
to think and plan at the level of individual papers. Basically,
you have three content chapters of your thesis, and
so if you have three strong papers that fit together
thematically, then you set up one paper per each chapter,
and there you are! No sweat.
I call
this the “PhD Comics Guide to Writing Your Thesis.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1047">Amount of time writing one email</a>. I saw this comic
when I was a junior professor, and
I immediately realized: (a) this is so true,
and (b) I needed to act more like the professor
in the comic strip. This is how I learned
that when you have
many things to decide, you must decide quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1436">The evolution of intellectual freedom</a>.
Sometimes you have
to take big risks in your work
and follow your own star. Once you learn
the basic technical skills needed for research, it is so easy
to do only incremental work, follow what the cool people are doing, and focus on what’s likely
to get you jobs and funding. There are good reasons to do
some of this, but if this is all that you do,
then why are you in research?</p>

   A set o' dull, conceited hashes<br>
   Confuse their brains in college-classes!<br>
