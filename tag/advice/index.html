    <p class="summary"><p>It’s hard to remember what machine learning conferences were like in person, but I think that I liked them a lot better when the field was smaller. It was easier to meet new people, to talk about new ideas in small groups of talented people who were really excited by them. The culture of the field has changed from back then, in intellectual ways that you know already, but the social ways are worth reflecting on, too.</p>

<p>Romanticizing the past is a sorry hobby for old men. I will not do that. All research communities have a callous system at their core — I’ve written about the <a href="/2018/03/tournament-axe.html">toxic</a> <a href="/2018/04/worth.html">forces</a> that drive and derail research careers — that’s always been the case.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>I’m a sucker for New Year’s resolutions.
Every year I make up a half dozen resolutions,
usually the same ones each year, and carefully track
my progress for at least two or three months
before I get busy and forget all about them.
And in all seriousness, I’m happy about this, because
sometimes, for maybe one resolution in four,
I’m still able to make a lasting
change in my habits. That’s more than enough
to justify the effort,
as long as I take the failures in good humor.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>A lot of scientific communication happens at
poster sessions. It’s a great way to learn
about the field, and to meet new people
with similar research interests. It’s also a great
way to be noticed in a crowded research field.
Presenting a poster is just as important,
and requires as much specialized skill,
as giving a 25-minute talk.
Way back when, before this blog became what it is, I wrote advice for <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/advice/posters.html">presenting research posters</a>.
Back when I started attending research conferences,
advice like that was probably good enough.</p>

When people ask you a important and difficult question like this, usually the best thing is to think of someone else who can give a better answer than you. For time management, an obvious person to turn to is the late Randy Pausch, a noted computer scientist who became an internet sensation because of <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/book/">an inspirational lecture</a> that he gave after he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>Of the many quirks shared by computer scientists, one that has somewhat entered the popular culture is the use of computing metaphors to speak about how we think. For example, “multitasking” is actually a technical term invented by computer scientists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking">in the 1960s</a> to describe the way a computer pretends to execute many programs at once, even if in reality it can only do one thing at a time. You can see why the term would have been quickly co-opted to metaphorically describe humans who attempt the same trick.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>A large part of taste in research is deciding what <em>not</em> to work on. You might choose not to apply method X, even though you don’t really understand it, because it has a reputation for being fiddly and difficult to get right. You might choose not to work on topic Y because you think that even though there’s a lot of people writing papers about it, its goals are too ambitious to ever be met. This extends all the way to entire fields of research. I could name a few popular fields within computer science — with active research communities, large amounts of external research funding, leading researchers with fancy prestigious awards — that I suspect are being investigated in entirely the wrong way, and that I personally think are currently pointless.</p>
