    <p class="summary"><p>Several students have recently asked me for advice about time management. When people ask you a important and difficult question like this, usually the best thing is to think of someone else who can give a better answer than you. For time management, an obvious person to turn to is the late Randy Pausch, a noted computer scientist who became an internet sensation because of <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/book/">an inspirational lecture</a> that he gave after he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>Of the many quirks shared by computer scientists, one that has somewhat entered the popular culture is the use of computing metaphors to speak about how we think. For example, “multitasking” is actually a technical term invented by computer scientists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking">in the 1960s</a> to describe the way a computer pretends to execute many programs at once, even if in reality it can only do one thing at a time. You can see why the term would have been quickly co-opted to metaphorically describe humans who attempt the same trick.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>Years ago I attended a lecture from a famous master of the game of Go.
He is revered not only for the many championships he has won, or even for his daring
and distinctive style, but also for his insightful and even witty commentary on the games
of other professionals. All of us who attended expected a once-in-a-lifetime treat.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>One of my favourite aspects of academia in the UK is the final oral examination for the PhD — formally called a <em>viva voce</em>, which everyone seems to call a <em>viva</em> (VEYE-vah). The viva is an oral examination that typically consists of the student and two examiners, one from within the University (the internal examiner), and one from outwith the university (the external examiner).</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>A large part of taste in research is deciding what <em>not</em> to work on. You might choose not to apply method X, even though you don’t really understand it, because it has a reputation for being fiddly and difficult to get right. You might choose not to work on topic Y because you think that even though there’s a lot of people writing papers about it, its goals are too ambitious to ever be met. This extends all the way to entire fields of research. I could name a few popular fields within computer science — with active research communities, large amounts of external research funding, leading researchers with fancy prestigious awards — that I suspect are being investigated in entirely the wrong way, and that I personally think are currently pointless.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p><a href="http://zenhabits.net/tips-for-gtds-ubiquitous-capture/">Ubiquitous capture</a> is a great term from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>. Like the best ideas from GTD, it is simple, obvious in retrospect, but changes everything. Ubiquitous capture means: When you think of something, you should write it down, right away, in some place where you will check it later.</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>It seems customary for computer science research papers to list directions for future work at the end. This custom is immensely strange. If your idea for future work is really good, the last thing you want to do is tell everyone about it. Literally the last thing: right after you’ve done the research and written it up! On other hand, if the idea for future work is bad, why do you want other people to see it?</p>

    <p class="summary"><p>A rite of passage for US PhD students is the title page of their dissertation. The way that faculty indicate their approval of the final dissertation is by signing the title page, and students are required to leave space on the title page for this purpose. It’s up to the student to run around to all their committee members (mine had 5) and get them to sign. Holding the final title page, with all the signatures, this bland sheet of acid-free paper that signifies that your hard work has come to something… it’s a heady feeling.</p>

Programming for research is very different than programming for industry. There are several reasons for this, which I will call Principles of Research Code. These principles underly all of the advice in Ali’s post and in this post. These principles are:</p>
