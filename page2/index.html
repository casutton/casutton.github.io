         <h1><a href="/2018/12/poster.html">How to Present a Scientific Poster at a Mega-Conference</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on December 30, 2018
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>A lot of scientific communication happens at
poster sessions. It’s a great way to learn
about the field, and to meet new people
with similar research interests. It’s also a great
way to be noticed in a crowded research field.
Presenting a poster is just as important,
and requires as much specialized skill,
as giving a 25-minute talk.
Way back when, before this blog became what it is, I wrote advice for <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/advice/posters.html">presenting research posters</a>.
Back when I started attending research conferences,
advice like that was probably good enough.</p>

<p>But these days, I think we need a few more
tricks in our poster-presenting sleeves.
One of my favourite recent conferences,
NeurIPS, had over 9000 attendees this year.
Unavoidably, the room was a little bit loud, and
it wasn’t unusual for a poster to have
twenty people around it.
<em>When the conference gets this large,
you need to present your poster differently.</em>
I saw posters where
one presenter carefully and quietly explained the poster
to one person, both of them intently facing the poster,
cheerfully oblivious to the fact that ten people were standing
behind them, patiently reading the poster.
If you are the presenter, don’t do this!</p>

<p>Instead, follow Sutton’s Three Rules for Presenting
a Popular Poster at a Mega-Conference:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be aware of what’s going on around you.</strong>
While you’re talking about your poster, people will
be both joining and leaving your audience.
You need to keep track of this.
First, this lets you acknowledge someone who joins,
by making eye contact and giving a quick smile or nod
as you speak. (I’m not too proud to admit that although
I try to do this for everyone, I’m even more likely to
do this when the new person is someone I know,
or someone famous.)
Second, having awareness lets you adapt your presentation,
because the way you talk to 2 or 3 people is different than
the way you talk to a crowd of 15 people. How so?
See the next two points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use your body language.</strong>
Congratulations! Your work has attracted a crowd,
and you have maintained the presence of mind to
notice. Now what?</p>

    <p>Continue your short talk about the paper,
just like you had before. You just need to make clear that
you are talking to the whole group rather than one person.
You do that with your body language.</p>

    <p>Face the entire group. Make yourself big.
Put your feet just a bit farther apart,
your shoulders up, your arms away from your body, and
your gestures large, so that everyone can see you.
Look around the entire group as you speak.
If you are doing this right, there will be a large semicircle around the poster, and you will be in a prominent
position at one side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You need to speak up.</strong> If people can’t hear you,
they will move on to the next poster. You need to speak
loudly enough that you can be heard 15 feet away in a
loud room. My voice is naturally on the loud side,
but even I had to consciously exert my full effort
to project my voice
while I was presenting our NeurIPS poster.</p>

    <p>There are techniques for doing this without straining
your voice.
If your profession involves speaking, as is common
in academia, it might help to learn about this.
“The Right to Speak” by Patsy Rosenberg is one
book that has been recommended to me.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>What’s that you say? It’s hard to do all of that
while talking about research at the same time?
Yes! It is. That’s why you need to practice your short presentation
until you know it well. This leaves you with mental
space that you can use to focus on your audience.
(Actually, this is good advice for all talks.)</p>

<p>The transition from “small group poster talk”
to “large group poster talk” can be awkward, but you
manage it. You can say something to the earlier group like,
“I’m going to reset the presentation for these new people,
but feel free to jump in if you think of more questions.”
Stuff like that.</p>

<p>One time, I had just started presenting
the poster to one person when a group seemed to come
up out of nowhere. I just looked at my faithful
original audience and said, “You might want to take
a step back, because I’m about to shout.” I did, and he did. I didn’t restart my talk, but I added in a few background phrases here
and there to help the larger group get context.</p>

         <h1><a href="/2018/09/impostor.html">Stress in Research. Part V&#58 If you really are an Impostor, then it's not a Syndrome</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on September  3, 2018

<blockquote>
As you know, there isn’t really any solution to self-doubt. In the end,
you just have to write and doubt simultaneously.

<p><em>The final post of a series on
<a href="/tag/stress%20in%20research">stress in research</a>.</em></p>

<p>A nice way to end this series would be to talk about <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1973">impostor syndrome</a>,
but I’m the wrong
person to write that blog, because I don’t think that I’ve ever literally
felt like an impostor. My self-doubt comes out in a different way.</p>

<p>I’ll need to get a bit more personal, but an important warning first.
If you are currently serving on a committee that is considering whether to offer
me a new job, promotion, prize, or award, please can you stop reading now.
Thank you.</p>

<p>My self-doubt comes out like this.
I am secretly convinced that I am not good enough.</p>

<p>We have already discussed how the
<a href="/2018/03/tournament-axe.html">Tournament of Research</a>
is public. So I can see the accomplishments of those who have surpassed me
in the Tournament, and secretly doubt whether I am good enough to compete.</p>

<p>I can see how quickly the field is moving, and how many new ideas
are being introduced every few weeks, and secretly doubt
whether I am good enough to keep up.</p>

<p>I can see the pressing  problems that our research
field is facing. I secretly doubt whether I am clever enough to create new ideas
that are subtle enough to solve these tricky problems.
I doubt whether I am good
enough to create the kind of work that I would like to create.</p>

<p>This <a href="/tag/stress%20in%20research">series of articles</a> has had
three themes: one theoretical, one practical,
and one psychological. The theoretical insight is that
the research
community is structured in a way to grow and foster
your self-doubt, and it succeeds in almost all of us.
Self-doubt is, therefore, not your fault.
More practically, self-talk can be a good way to continue doing
good work in the face of self doubt. The psychological
theme has been on the role of ego in research:
necessary, but always carrying the dangers of jealousy
and doubt. Combining the final two themes,
the last advice I will give about
self-doubt is about using self-talk to manage your ego.</p>

<p>A lot of advice suggests fighting self-doubt
with positive self-talk: “I really am good enough! I belong here!”  Try this and see if it helps you. Different
strategies will work for different people. For me,
positive self-talk does not seem to help; it is too hard
for me for disregard the objective evidence that
there really are people out there who are better than me.</p>

<p>So instead of reaffirming my ego, I use self-talk
to deny my ego. I push my thoughts away from myself,
and towards the tasks in front of me, which
are easy to get excited about, and then the fear goes away.
Imagine an actor, petrified with fear while
waiting to go on, who once onstage and forced to perform,
slips into the role without effort or doubt.
I try to feel like that when I sit down to my laptop.
Said another way: People report the fear that they <em>are</em>
an impostor. But it does not matter what you <em>are</em>,
it matters what you <em>do</em>.</p>

<p>Because, in the end, none of the dark thoughts matter.
I am inadequate, I am not good enough, and it does not matter.
It does not matter because all the doubts, all the dark thoughts, are self centered claptrap,
exercises in destructive solipsism.  The doubts are all about me,
but when it comes to work, how I feel is unimportant.</p>

<p><em>It does not matter how good I am.</em></p>

<p>As long as I love the work
that I do, and people are willing to pay me to do it,</p>

<p>As long as I continue to learn through my work,
to learn from my students, colleagues, and collaborators,
at the same time that they seem to be learning from me,</p>

<p>As long as I can see new directions for my work,
to expand my knowledge and perhaps others’ as well,</p>

<p>As long as there is a chance, even a slim one, that I can create something
that will change the way people think, or in a small way, improve
the way the world works,</p>

<p>As long as I can <em>do</em> all this, it does not matter how good I <em>am</em>.
As long as there remains much to do,
I am going to try to do it, whether I am good enough or not.</p>

<p>Even if I reach the end of my career, and never do something that ever fully
matches my ambitions, my work will have accomplished
something, even if indirectly and in a small way.
I have had the privilege to participate in the worldwide, centuries-long conversation
of the community of scholars. And this larger conversation
has made a difference, I am sure, even if my own part has been small.
I have been part of the life of the research community, preserving, growing, and sharing
knowledge. That is
 enough to make my professional life worthwhile, even after all the papers that I’ve written have faded into obscurity.</p>

<p>And that’s how I deal with self doubt.</p>

         <h1><a href="/2018/08/deprecation.html">Ill-Judged Britishness, and Self-Deprecation within a Power Dynamic</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on August  5, 2018
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>I really should know better. Twice now, I’ve done this to myself.
I was a social event with one of my PhD students,
like a party during a conference, where I was introducing
them to a colleague. Feeling relaxed after a beer
or two, I attempted an ill-judged joke, “So-and-so has
the misfortune of being one of my students.”</p>

<p>Often that type of humour works well for me,
and is enjoyed all around. Well, maybe I’m not perceptive
enough to tell if anyone else enjoys it, but I do.</p>

<p>The misfortunate joke never works, though. Both times the student turned
and looked at me like I had three heads.
Why would I say something like that about myself? Why would
being my PhD student be a bad thing?</p>

<p>The second time this happened, I at least maintained
enough poise to explain myself. “Nothing to worry about,” I said quietly
to my student. “I’m just feeling a bit British.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Self-deprecation,” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course.” Immediate understanding.</p>

         <h1><a href="/2018/07/logistic-tsunami.html">Stress in Research. Part IV&#58 A Tsunami of Logistics</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on July  7, 2018
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p><em>The fourth in a tidal wave of posts about
<a href="/tag/stress%20in%20research">stress in research</a>.</em></p>

<p>Here’s a source of stress for people who have gotten a bit more senior
in their careers, like new professors or managers.</p>

<p>On a previous post in the series, a colleague commented:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What gets me is the daily tsunami of logistics: questions that need responses,
decisions that have to be made, scheduling, and millions of small deadlines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every new professor mentions this. If senior professors complain about this
less often, perhaps it is because they are simply better at ignoring questions
that need responses. More on that later.</p>

<p>Making decisions is stressful for those who lack the training or personality.
A PhD trains you to think deeply and carefully about an issue.
Scientifically speaking, you want to reserve judgment when you don’t have all of
the information, not go ahead and make a snap decision anyway.
As an administrator, though, sometimes that is exactly what you must do.
Maybe the thing that stresses me the most, though, is when I inevitably fall
behind the tsunami, I hate the feeling that I’m letting people down.
This feeling is actually one of the things that bothers me most about
academia, even though I’m well aware that if I did spend all of my
time attending to logistics promptly, I would still be letting people down,
in a deeper way.</p>

<p>The logistics tsunami is, like all tsunamis, perilous. The obvious danger
is that you spend so much time sending emails
<a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/email_monster">like a tired diplomat</a>
that you lose your time for work that requires deeper thought.
Your ability to do deep work is why you won your job in the first place,
so not doing it once you’ve reached a higher level is not so great.</p>

<p>The logistics tsunami brings another, more insidious danger.
This danger is not about losing
your time but losing your mind. Your unconscious mind, I mean.
A lot of our most important thinking happens unconsciously,
our brains churning in the background while our focus is elsewhere,
until the wonderful moment when a thought finally pops into our consciousness,
like Athena in the mind of Zeus.
For me, this usually happens when I’m walking.
For you, it might be in the shower, or when you are sitting with your coffee.
I really like the way that Female Science Professor talks about
<a href="http://science-professor.blogspot.com/2014/11/this-is-your-brain-on-administration.html">your brain on administration</a>.
When you start doing too much administration, the tsunami starts to take
over your unconscious mind, and the wonderful ideas that pop up start to be
about what you can spend a tiny slice of your grant budget on, or
how to phrase that sensitive email, instead of what to write your
next paper about. This is the most terrible danger.</p>

<p>I have now delayed for too long the part of the blog where I explain my
optimistic but wise, surprising but helpful, advice on how
to manage the tsunami. I am afraid that I must report that
the delay didn’t help me come up with any better ideas.
All I can say is</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>When you have many decisions, you must decide quickly.</em> This is the secret
that good decider-people know that you and I don’t. Me, I like to mull over
things. Then by the time I actually make a decision, I know I’m sure,
so I feel a lot better about it. That’s OK for big decisions, but not so good
for deciding whether you want to meet tomorrow at 1pm or 2pm.
When it doesn’t really matter, wrap up the matter quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Learn how to partition your time.</em> Deep thinking requires uninterrupted
blocks of time. These are hard to find, but you must.
I think that the optimal block size varies from person
to person. Some people split things up by day.
You could have “teaching days”, “admin days”, “research days”, and so on.
Some people enforce no-meeting days. Some people will work Sundays,
but only on research.
Some people don’t check email before 4PM.
Some people send lots of emails late at night because they’re tired anyway.
I don’t split things up by day, because I like to do small tasks
when I get tired from concentrating. I make sure to schedule meetings back
to back, to try to keep blocks of time for deeper work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Protect the time when you are most creative.</em> When you go to partition
your time, you’ll want to remember what time of day you are most creative
and have the most energy. That is the time that you need to reserve for
the most creative work. If people often drop by your office — we all love
an open door policy — then this is the time to not <em>be</em> in your
office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Make good use of odd chunks of time.</em> As much as we bemoan smartphones,
they shine at this. If you only have 10 minutes until your next meeting,
the tsunami will happily offer you things that take only 10 minutes to do.
To be an effective professor, you need to play Tetris with time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>You need a to-do list.</em> If you know about things you need to do
that aren’t written down, a part of your unconscious will repeat them over
and over, so you don’t forget. You have many more important jobs for
your unconscious mind than that. I like the principles behind the
<a href="/2015/11/gtd-made-simple-why-i-think-internet.html">Getting Things Done system</a>
very much, although my practice is distinctly imperfect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Find a fast way to schedule meetings.</em> Really a special case of the first
principle. If you spend 20 hours a week in meetings, it’s easy to spend
a couple hours a week arranging meetings. You need to make arranging a time
as simple as possible, using whatever tools work for you. For example,
I have my Google calendar hooked up to Doodle, so when an administrator
sends out a Doodle poll, I can respond in one click. Some online calendars
have features for creating appointment slots. Some people publish their
free/busy schedule publicly. Whatever works for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Know when “good enough” is good enough.</em> The easiest way to get more things
done is to spend less time doing each thing. Your research requires certain
habits of mind, careful and precise thought, perhaps. I guarantee you that
this level of clarity and precision is not required for your emails.
Jenny Pickerill has a nice
<a href="https://twitter.com/JennyPickerill/status/985780112112091141">Twitter thread on satisficing</a>
as a professor.
Satisficing is more painful for tasks that are more central
to our mission. Any university class can be made 20% better at the cost
of twice as much prep time — don’t do it. (I received this advice,
second hand, from an award-winning lecturer!) I’m not saying that
you should be puzzling out your colleague’s slides for the first time
in front of the class, either. You need to find something in the middle,
and the same goes for the service that you do inside and outside
of the university.</p>
  </li>

         <h1><a href="/2018/06/mafia.html">Social Skills in Context, or How being a Professor is Kind of Like Being a Mafia Hitman</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on June  1, 2018
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Ruggiero">Benjamin “Lefty Guns” Ruggiero</a>
was a fearsome Mafia hitman in New York in the 70s.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Pistone">an undercover FBI agent</a>
who knew him well, he was smart and savvy in underworld situations.
He could walk into a restaurant where he knew no one,
watch who talked to who, watch how they talked,
and work out who was in the underworld, who received more deference,
whether the restaurant was being extorted.</p>

<p>In other situations, a different story. The FBI agent,
Joseph Pistone, was himself an incredibly perceptive observer
(if he wasn’t, he’d have been murdered). He reports:</p>

<figure class="quote">
<blockquote>
A lot of these wiseguys did not have the ability to move around the country.
Once you got these guys out of New York City, they were like fish out of water....
As they schooled me in the mafia, I had to school them on how to make airline reservations.
I am talking about a 49-year-old man,
telling him how to make airline reservations to three different cities, with an
open return, because we
did not know what date we were going to return to New York City.
</blockquote>
<figcaption class="quote-source">
  <span class="quote-author">Joseph Pistone</span>
  <cite class="quote-title">Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia</cite>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of course I was immediately reminded of computer science research.
In research situations, I think of myself as reasonably socially aware:
I have a network of mentors, students, and collaborators;
I can meet new colleagues and have interesting technical discussions;
I can even navigate the occasional difficult conversation when the need
arises.</p>

<p>But outside of work, I can be a bit more awkward,
or at least that’s what my wife says.</p>

<p>We stereotype technical people as having low social skills, and
I’ll admit knowing people who fully meet that stereotype.
The Mafia hitman reminds us that social skills are context specific:
you can be savvy in one type of situation, and clueless in another.
“Social skills” aren’t a single skill, any more than intellectual
skills are.</p>

<p>And the term implies something else. Social skills are skills.
You can learn them.
And it is in the interests of your career to do so.</p>

	   <p class="poem">
   A set o' dull, conceited hashes<br>
   Confuse their brains in college-classes!<br>
	   They gang in stirks, and come out asses<br>
	   Plain truth to speak; <br>
An' syne they think to climb Parnassus <br>
By dint o' Greek!
