         <div class="entry">
         <p>Due to a recent bout of jet lag,<sup><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> I have found myself this week waking up at 5am.
So I am experimenting with reading a paper first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>I am hoping that starting off the day with an intellectual task will help me to avoid
“administrator brain”, which <a href="http://science-professor.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/this-is-your-brain-on-administration.html">FSP describes in an excellent post</a>.</p>

<p>So far (well, two days in) it has been really fun. It helps me to stay motivated, because after writing 50 emails in a day, your mind gets lost in minutiae, and you forget that you came to this job to learn, to help people, and to be creative.</p>

<p>Can’t promise that I’ll keep waking up at 5am, though.</p>

    <p>I have begin scheduling posts well in advance, so this bout will no longer be recent when you read this. <a href="#fnref-1" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></p>

         <h1><a href="/2014/12/taste-in-research-and-paradox-of.html">Taste in research, and the paradox of deciding what not to work on</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on December  6, 2014
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>A large part of taste in research is deciding what <em>not</em> to work on. You might choose not to apply method X, even though you don’t really understand it, because it has a reputation for being fiddly and difficult to get right. You might choose not to work on topic Y because you think that even though there’s a lot of people writing papers about it, its goals are too ambitious to ever be met. This extends all the way to entire fields of research. I could name a few popular fields within computer science — with active research communities, large amounts of external research funding, leading researchers with fancy prestigious awards — that I suspect are being investigated in entirely the wrong way, and that I personally think are currently pointless.</p>

<p>I <em>could</em> name them. Will I? No.</p>

<p>Why not? To protect my career? If I am honest, probably in part yes. But what I tell myself is different. The real answer, I think, is that my opinion of these areas is poorly informed. Because I think these areas are uninteresting, I haven’t studied them carefully, and so I don’t know how they’ve attempted to address my naive objections. It would be arrogant and professionally irresponsible to publicly denigrate the hard work of many people without having even bothered to read it.</p>

<p>This leads to a paradox. It’s impossible <em>by definition</em> for me to become better informed about these areas, unless I decide to actually start researching them. In order to be fully confident that an area is uninteresting, you need to study it — and that study itself is part of doing research! But you can’t do careful reading on every research area that seems bogus at first impression, because then you would do nothing else. Instead, you have to take intellectual shortcuts, and do the best you can with limited time to think. Those research areas that smell a bit off, you ignore them until either they die out, or a major success forces you to reevaluate. Part of taste in research is deciding what to study, and what to ignore.</p>

<p>This is the paradox of taste in research. Your decision of what not to work on is, by definition, always ill-informed.</p>

         <div class="entry">
         <p>I walked home past several people setting off sparklers and fireworks in the meadows. In Edinburgh celebrations of Guy Fawkes night are not elaborate, but you can smell the gunpowder.</p>

<p>A good thing, because otherwise I can never remember what night it is. The traditional rhyme</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>     Remember, remember, the fifth of November</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is about the worst possible mnemonic that I could think of. It fits the meter just as well to say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>     Remember, remember, the FOURTH of November</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but you aren’t meant to remember that one. Personally I prefer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>     Remember, remember, the ninth of November,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because that happens also to be my birthday.</p>

<p>Much more sensible to base the rhyme on the part that’s easiest to confuse.
Instead, how about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let the memory survive
      That the king was still alive
          On November five.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you won’t forget.</p>

         <h1><a href="/2014/11/business-cards-and-me.html">Business Cards and Me</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on November  1, 2014
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>Just before I went to my first conference, I thought, “Hey, I guess I should be professional now!” and printed out business cards on the best card stock that I could find at Staples. Apparently, of the hundreds of people who attended NIPS that year, I was the only one who had done this. I handed out one card, received none, and assumed that everyone must just Google each other after the conference.</p>

<p>From an objective standpoint, from the perspective of maximizing the efficiency of scholarly communication, this is of course ridiculous. The only explanation that I can imagine is reverse snobbery, the same reason we would never wear a suit and tie to work. But at the time, I didn’t worry about this. I just did what everyone else did.</p>

<p>I’m eleven years older now, and my memory is much worse. At the last conference I attended, I thought, “Hey, wouldn’t it be great if next time, I could go home with a list of every new person that I met, perhaps on a durable but unobtrusive slip of paper?” I do worry about people giving me funny looks, but I can’t very well pretend to myself that I am creative and iconoclastic if I always do what my friends do.</p>

<p>So if I meet you at NIPS this year, do not be surprised if you receive an unobtrusive slip of paper from me. I hope that you enjoy the word cloud on the back.</p>

         <h1><a href="/2014/08/a-threat-to-british-monarchy.html">A Threat to the British Monarchy</a></h1>

         <div class="author">
By Charles Sutton on August 16, 2014
</div>



         <div class="entry">
         <p>I’d like to talk frankly about a real threat to the British monarchy.</p>

<p>First, monarchs like to emphasize continuity and tradition by reusing names from previous monarchs. This is understandable as, in a constitutional monarchy, continuity and tradition are the monarchy’s main assets. Perhaps for this reason, a British king hasn’t taken on a previously unused name since George I in 1714.</p>

<p>However, this bumps up against a contradictory historical tendency, namely that British monarchs have had what might be described as a rich and varied history. British kings aren’t eager to remind people of their more colourful predecessors. Many names are therefore out of bounds.</p>

<p>The result is that the British monarchy is rapidly running out of names in the male line. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Henry</strong> — It is difficult to imagine the king who would want to be Henry IX, and even more difficult to imagine the woman who would want to marry him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Richard</strong> — Who wants to be the successor of the King in the Car Park? And there was the business with the Princes in the Tower.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Edward</strong> — Although the abdication of Edward VIII might be viewed more romantically by modern eyes, the Nazi sympathies, not so much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>John</strong> — The Magna Carta was written to protect people <em>from him</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>James</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism">is right out</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you factor in this history, there are very few names left. Charles is still OK. Charles II granted the charter of the Royal Society; perhaps a future Charles III could also take an interest in science. William and George are unimpeachable. Albert is a possibility, although the famous Albert was only a consort, making the name a bit of a risk: the last prospective King Albert decided at the crucial moment to become a George instead.</p>

<p>This is shaping into a crisis. One can imagine a time, in the coming centuries, when the only choices left to British kings are Charles, George, and Cnut.</p>
