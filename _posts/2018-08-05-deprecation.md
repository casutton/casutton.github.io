I really should know better. Twice now, I've been in the situation.
I was a social event with one of my PhD students,
like a party during a conference, where I was introducing
them to a colleague. Feeling relaxed after a beer
or two, I attempted an ill-judged joke, "So-and-so has
the misfortune of being one of my students."

Often that type of humour works well for me,
and is enjoyed all around. Well, maybe I'm not perceptive
enough to tell if anyone else enjoys it, but I do.

The misfortunate joke never works, though. Both times the student turned
and looked at me like I had three heads.
Why would I say something like that about myself? Why would
being my PhD student be a bad thing?

The second time this happened, I at least maintained
enough poise to explain myself. "Nothing to worry about," I said quietly
to my student. "I'm just feeling a bit British."

"How?"

"Self-deprecation," I said.

"Oh, of course." Immediate understanding.
