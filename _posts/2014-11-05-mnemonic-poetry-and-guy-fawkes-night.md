I walked home past several people setting off sparklers and fireworks in the meadows. In Edinburgh celebrations of Guy Fawkes night are not elaborate, but you can smell the gunpowder.

A good thing, because otherwise I can never remember what night it is. The traditional rhyme

>      Remember, remember, the fifth of November

is about the worst possible mnemonic that I could think of. It fits the meter just as well to say

>      Remember, remember, the FOURTH of November

but you aren't meant to remember that one. Personally I prefer

>      Remember, remember, the ninth of November,

because that happens also to be my birthday.

Much more sensible to base the rhyme on the part that's easiest to confuse.
Instead, how about:

> Let the memory survive
>       That the king was still alive
>           On November five.

Now you won't forget.
