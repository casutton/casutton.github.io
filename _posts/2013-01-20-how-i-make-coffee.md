Pourover is a trendy and delicious way of making coffee. It is possible to make excellent coffee this way. [This video by Matt Perger](http://vimeo.com/46612013) has a great technique for the Hario V60, which the one that I have been playing with since receiving it for my birthday.

Here's a summary of the video. You will probably need to watch the vide for this to make sense:

12g coffee
200g water
brewing time 2:20 total

1.  Add 50g water. Stir. Let bloom.
2.  At 0:30, add 50g water in outward spiral. Make sure no grounds are above water line
3.  At 1:00, add remaining 100g water in spiral pattern, again washing the grounds down the edges.
4.  Around 1:30 or so reseat dripper to even out bed of grounds

How do you know it's 50g of water? Place your mug on top of a digital scale before pouring.

What kind of kettle do you pour the water from? Unfortunately, this really does matter. It's important that the grounds be completely saturated with water, and that you pour the water slowly. Otherwise, you will create channels through the grounds through which most of the water will pass, causing part of the grounds to be overextracted and bitter. I am told that the Hario kettle is excellent, because it has a narrow swan neck which allows the water to poured slowly and precisely. But it also costs 50 pounds! It is difficult to find a similar kettle that is reasonably priced, but I have just gotten [this Tiamo kettle](http://www.homeloo.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=933&currency=GBP) and so far, so good.
