If you're reading this blog, then you already know about
[PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com). If you really haven't
seen them before, click the link and read them now.
They are more insightful and funnier than anything
in this blog.

It goes without saying, however, that
you should not model your own career
on the characters in the PhD comics strip.
For one thing, they've been in grad school
for more than 20 years.

Amazingly, though, there are three PhD comic strips,
and probably only three,
that are actually good research advice:

* [Writing your thesis outline.](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=715)
A thesis is daunting. How do you write an entire
book over five-plus years? Instead, I like to tell my students
to think and plan at the level of individual papers. Basically,
you have three content chapters of your thesis, and
so if you have three strong papers that fit together
thematically, then you set up one paper per each chapter,
and there you are! No sweat.
I call
this the "PhD Comics Guide to Writing Your Thesis."

* [Amount of time writing one email](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1047). I saw this comic
when I was a junior professor, and
I immediately realized: (a) this is so true,
and (b) I needed to act more like the professor
in the comic strip. This is how I learned
that when you have
many things to decide, you must decide quickly.

* [The evolution of intellectual freedom](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1436).
Sometimes you have
to take big risks in your work
and follow your own star. Once you learn
the basic technical skills needed for research, it is so easy
to do only incremental work, follow what the cool people are doing, and focus on what's likely
to get you jobs and funding. There are good reasons to do
some of this, but if this is all that you do,
then why are you in research?

  An alternate way to interpret this comic is based on a
comment I heard in a talk from Daniel Marcu.
Even in academia, you always have customers for your research,
just as businesses have customers and artists have
an audience.
