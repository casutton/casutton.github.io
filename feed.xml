I gave the best answer that I could, but I’m not sure that my best was
very good. Can you help? If so, join the discussion on social media
(or send me a note privately):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am currently studying for a master’s at [a good university outside
the United States &lt;em&gt;-cas&lt;/em&gt;] while working part-time as an NLP research engineer. I would like to ask you for some advice if that was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;My question is: without having outstanding grades or publications in top AI journals, how could I find my way towards a top Ph.D. program or at least research internship, is there any possibility? I am currently working on deep learning (paid job) and have some Ph.D. offers. Still, I feel that internships at companies like Google or Ph.D. positions at top research centers are impossible without previous experience in a similar place, which is like a snake biting its tail. Except for students with massive GPA scores, which is not my case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I am happy with my current job, but so far, I have just been able to grasp the opportunities that I found, so I am thinking about trying to go abroad. Everything I have found is very applied, and I would like to study more abstract or generic (even exotic) topics, instead of applying existing neural architectures to specific domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots and lots of applicants to computer science PhD programs want to do machine learning, so admissions is very competitive. I don’t think it’s necessary to have publications to get into a PhD program, although it does help, and the higher you go in the rankings, the more that you need any help that you can get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that I have better advice than to learn as much as you can, do good work, network with others, and work your way up the prestige ladder. 
It’s true that going to a very highly ranked school gives you an advantage, but I know very good researchers who did not have very good grades in undergrad, and even if you do your PhD at a lower ranked place, if your work is good, it still can stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, a question for my readers (all three of them),
what do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="questions from readers" /><summary type="html">I got a question the other day about how to start a career in machine learning.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://phdcomics.com&quot;&gt;PhD Comics&lt;/a&gt;. If you really haven’t
seen them before, click the link and read them now.
They are more insightful and funnier than anything
in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying, however, that
you should not model your own career
on the characters in the PhD comics strip.
For one thing, they’ve been in grad school
for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, though, there are three PhD comic strips,
and probably only three,
that are actually good research advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=715&quot;&gt;Writing your thesis outline.&lt;/a&gt;
A thesis is daunting. How do you write an entire
book over five-plus years? Instead, I like to tell my students
to think and plan at the level of individual papers. Basically,
you have three content chapters of your thesis, and
so if you have three strong papers that fit together
thematically, then you set up one paper per each chapter,
and there you are! No sweat.
I call
this the “PhD Comics Guide to Writing Your Thesis.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1047&quot;&gt;Amount of time writing one email&lt;/a&gt;. I saw this comic
when I was a junior professor, and
I immediately realized: (a) this is so true,
and (b) I needed to act more like the professor
in the comic strip. This is how I learned
that when you have
many things to decide, you must decide quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1436&quot;&gt;The evolution of intellectual freedom&lt;/a&gt;.
Sometimes you have
to take big risks in your work
and follow your own star. Once you learn
the basic technical skills needed for research, it is so easy
to do only incremental work, follow what the cool people are doing, and focus on what’s likely
to get you jobs and funding. There are good reasons to do
some of this, but if this is all that you do,
then why are you in research?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An alternate way to interpret this comic is based on a
comment I heard in a talk from Daniel Marcu.
Even in academia, you always have customers for your research,
just as businesses have customers and artists have
an audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

The New Year’s resolution that underlies all productivity advice</title><link href="http://www.theexclusive.org//2019/01/know-thyself.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Know thyself. The New Year's resolution that underlies all productivity advice" /><published>2019-01-05T08:40:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-01-05T08:40:00-08:00</updated><id>http://www.theexclusive.org//2019/01/know-thyself</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.theexclusive.org//2019/01/know-thyself.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a sucker for New Year’s resolutions.
Every year I make up a half dozen resolutions,
usually the same ones each year, and carefully track
my progress for at least two or three months
before I get busy and forget all about them.
And in all seriousness, I’m happy about this, because
sometimes, for maybe one resolution in four,
I’m still able to make a lasting
change in my habits. That’s more than enough
to justify the effort,
as long as I take the failures in good humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be as silly about resolutions as I am,
or even to have any resolutions at all, but the underlying
principle is important for any creative work.
You could say that it’s the underlying principle
behind all of the advice in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to know yourself, understand the way you think,
adapt the way you work to the way you think,
and always keep looking for ways to work better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have all kinds of little
preferences about when you are most alert, creative,
and productive. Maybe you like to work in the morning.
Maybe you like to have a bit of background noise,
like in a coffee shop. Maybe you need almost absolute
quiet. Maybe you like to work from home, or maybe
you prefer the structure of having an office,
where your work space is separate from home.
Maybe you like to pace around the office,
talking to yourself and gesticulating wildly.
Or maybe that’s just me. Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, you need to learn what makes
you think most effectively, and seek out that environment.
No one can do that for you. Your best work space
will be different
for you than it is for me. (And good thing, too, otherwise
  all of Google would be people bumping into each other
  in the hallways
  because they were too busy talking to themselves.)
The only way to know is to experiment and find out what
works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s also vital for us to keep experimenting,
no matter how senior we are in our careers.
One reason is (I think this is from David Allen),
“The better you get, the better you’d &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; get.”
As you become more accomplished, you gain a reputation
which means that more demands are placed on you.
Another reason is that no matter how good you are,
you haven’t learned all of the tricks.
Your mental rhythms change as you get older,
just as an athlete in his thirties trains differently
than a teenager. Finally, the creative challenges change
as you get later in your career, as you need to learn to
adapt to the way that the field has changed in twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s always appealed to me about the research
career is that you never stop learning.
This is as much true for how you set up
the environment of your work as it is for the
content of your work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="how to think" /><category term="creative productivity" /><summary type="html">I’m a sucker for New Year’s resolutions.

poster sessions. It’s a great way to learn
about the field, and to meet new people
with similar research interests. It’s also a great
way to be noticed in a crowded research field.
Presenting a poster is just as important,
and requires as much specialized skill,
as giving a 25-minute talk.
Way back when, before this blog became what it is, I wrote advice for &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/advice/posters.html&quot;&gt;presenting research posters&lt;/a&gt;.
Back when I started attending research conferences,
advice like that was probably good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these days, I think we need a few more
tricks in our poster-presenting sleeves.
One of my favourite recent conferences,
NeurIPS, had over 9000 attendees this year.
Unavoidably, the room was a little bit loud, and
it wasn’t unusual for a poster to have
twenty people around it.
&lt;em&gt;When the conference gets this large,
you need to present your poster differently.&lt;/em&gt;
I saw posters where
one presenter carefully and quietly explained the poster
to one person, both of them intently facing the poster,
cheerfully oblivious to the fact that ten people were standing
behind them, patiently reading the poster.
If you are the presenter, don’t do this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, follow Sutton’s Three Rules for Presenting
a Popular Poster at a Mega-Conference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware of what’s going on around you.&lt;/strong&gt;
While you’re talking about your poster, people will
be both joining and leaving your audience.
You need to keep track of this.
First, this lets you acknowledge someone who joins,
by making eye contact and giving a quick smile or nod
as you speak. (I’m not too proud to admit that although
I try to do this for everyone, I’m even more likely to
do this when the new person is someone I know,
or someone famous.)
Second, having awareness lets you adapt your presentation,
because the way you talk to 2 or 3 people is different than
the way you talk to a crowd of 15 people. How so?
See the next two points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your body language.&lt;/strong&gt;
Congratulations! Your work has attracted a crowd,
and you have maintained the presence of mind to
notice. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Continue your short talk about the paper,
just like you had before. You just need to make clear that
you are talking to the whole group rather than one person.
You do that with your body language.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Face the entire group. Make yourself big.
Put your feet just a bit farther apart,
your shoulders up, your arms away from your body, and
your gestures large, so that everyone can see you.
Look around the entire group as you speak.
If you are doing this right, there will be a large semicircle around the poster, and you will be in a prominent
position at one side.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to speak up.&lt;/strong&gt; If people can’t hear you,
they will move on to the next poster. You need to speak
loudly enough that you can be heard 15 feet away in a
loud room. My voice is naturally on the loud side,
but even I had to consciously exert my full effort
to project my voice
while I was presenting our NeurIPS poster.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are techniques for doing this without straining
your voice.
If your profession involves speaking, as is common
in academia, it might help to learn about this.
“The Right to Speak” by Patsy Rosenberg is one
book that has been recommended to me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s that you say? It’s hard to do all of that
while talking about research at the same time?
Yes! It is. That’s why you need to practice your short presentation
until you know it well. This leaves you with mental
space that you can use to focus on your audience.
(Actually, this is good advice for all talks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from “small group poster talk”
to “large group poster talk” can be awkward, but you
manage it. You can say something to the earlier group like,
“I’m going to reset the presentation for these new people,
but feel free to jump in if you think of more questions.”
Stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time, I had just started presenting
the poster to one person when a group seemed to come
up out of nowhere. I just looked at my faithful
original audience and said, “You might want to take
a step back, because I’m about to shout.” I did, and he did. I didn’t restart my talk, but I added in a few background phrases here
and there to help the larger group get context.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="presentation advice" /><summary type="html">A lot of scientific communication happens at poster sessions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As you know, there isn’t really any solution to self-doubt. In the end,
you just have to write and doubt simultaneously.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final post of a series on
&lt;a href=&quot;/tag/stress%20in%20research&quot;&gt;stress in research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice way to end this series would be to talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1973&quot;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt;,
but I’m the wrong
person to write that blog, because I don’t think that I’ve ever literally
felt like an impostor. My self-doubt comes out in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll need to get a bit more personal, but an important warning first.
If you are currently serving on a committee that is considering whether to offer
me a new job, promotion, prize, or award, please can you stop reading now.
Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My self-doubt comes out like this.
I am secretly convinced that I am not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already discussed how the
&lt;a href=&quot;/2018/03/tournament-axe.html&quot;&gt;Tournament of Research&lt;/a&gt;
is public. So I can see the accomplishments of those who have surpassed me
in the Tournament, and secretly doubt whether I am good enough to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see how quickly the field is moving, and how many new ideas
are being introduced every few weeks, and secretly doubt
whether I am good enough to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see the pressing  problems that our research
field is facing. I secretly doubt whether I am clever enough to create new ideas
that are subtle enough to solve these tricky problems.
I doubt whether I am good
enough to create the kind of work that I would like to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/stress%20in%20research&quot;&gt;series of articles&lt;/a&gt; has had
three themes: one theoretical, one practical,
and one psychological. The theoretical insight is that
the research
community is structured in a way to grow and foster
your self-doubt, and it succeeds in almost all of us.
Self-doubt is, therefore, not your fault.
More practically, self-talk can be a good way to continue doing
good work in the face of self doubt. The psychological
theme has been on the role of ego in research:
necessary, but always carrying the dangers of jealousy
and doubt. Combining the final two themes,
the last advice I will give about
self-doubt is about using self-talk to manage your ego.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of advice suggests fighting self-doubt
with positive self-talk: “I really am good enough! I belong here!”  Try this and see if it helps you. Different
strategies will work for different people. For me,
positive self-talk does not seem to help; it is too hard
for me for disregard the objective evidence that
there really are people out there who are better than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of reaffirming my ego, I use self-talk
to deny my ego. I push my thoughts away from myself,
and towards the tasks in front of me, which
are easy to get excited about, and then the fear goes away.
Imagine an actor, petrified with fear while
waiting to go on, who once onstage and forced to perform,
slips into the role without effort or doubt.
I try to feel like that when I sit down to my laptop.
Said another way: People report the fear that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;
an impostor. But it does not matter what you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;,
it matters what you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, in the end, none of the dark thoughts matter.
I am inadequate, I am not good enough, and it does not matter.
It does not matter because all the doubts, all the dark thoughts, are self centered claptrap,
exercises in destructive solipsism.  The doubts are all about me,
but when it comes to work, how I feel is unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It does not matter how good I am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as I love the work
that I do, and people are willing to pay me to do it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as I continue to learn through my work,
to learn from my students, colleagues, and collaborators,
at the same time that they seem to be learning from me,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as I can see new directions for my work,
to expand my knowledge and perhaps others’ as well,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as there is a chance, even a slim one, that I can create something
that will change the way people think, or in a small way, improve
the way the world works,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as I can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; all this, it does not matter how good I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt;.
As long as there remains much to do,
I am going to try to do it, whether I am good enough or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I reach the end of my career, and never do something that ever fully
matches my ambitions, my work will have accomplished
something, even if indirectly and in a small way.
I have had the privilege to participate in the worldwide, centuries-long conversation
of the community of scholars. And this larger conversation
has made a difference, I am sure, even if my own part has been small.
I have been part of the life of the research community, preserving, growing, and sharing
knowledge. That is
 enough to make my professional life worthwhile, even after all the papers that I’ve written have faded into obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s how I deal with self doubt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="stress in research" /><category term="popular" /><summary type="html">As you know, there isn’t really any solution to self-doubt.

Twice now, I’ve done this to myself.
I was a social event with one of my PhD students,
like a party during a conference, where I was introducing
them to a colleague. Feeling relaxed after a beer
or two, I attempted an ill-judged joke, “So-and-so has
the misfortune of being one of my students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often that type of humour works well for me,
and is enjoyed all around. Well, maybe I’m not perceptive
enough to tell if anyone else enjoys it, but I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The misfortunate joke never works, though. Both times the student turned
and looked at me like I had three heads.
Why would I say something like that about myself? Why would
being my PhD student be a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time this happened, I at least maintained
enough poise to explain myself. “Nothing to worry about,” I said quietly
to my student. “I’m just feeling a bit British.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;/tag/stress%20in%20research&quot;&gt;stress in research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a source of stress for people who have gotten a bit more senior
in their careers, like new professors or managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a previous post in the series, a colleague commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What gets me is the daily tsunami of logistics: questions that need responses,
decisions that have to be made, scheduling, and millions of small deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every new professor mentions this. If senior professors complain about this
less often, perhaps it is because they are simply better at ignoring questions
that need responses. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making decisions is stressful for those who lack the training or personality.
A PhD trains you to think deeply and carefully about an issue.
Scientifically speaking, you want to reserve judgment when you don’t have all of
the information, not go ahead and make a snap decision anyway.
As an administrator, though, sometimes that is exactly what you must do.
Maybe the thing that stresses me the most, though, is when I inevitably fall
behind the tsunami, I hate the feeling that I’m letting people down.
This feeling is actually one of the things that bothers me most about
academia, even though I’m well aware that if I did spend all of my
time attending to logistics promptly, I would still be letting people down,
in a deeper way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistics tsunami is, like all tsunamis, perilous. The obvious danger
is that you spend so much time sending emails
&lt;a href=&quot;http://theoatmeal.com/comics/email_monster&quot;&gt;like a tired diplomat&lt;/a&gt;
that you lose your time for work that requires deeper thought.
Your ability to do deep work is why you won your job in the first place,
so not doing it once you’ve reached a higher level is not so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistics tsunami brings another, more insidious danger.
This danger is not about losing
your time but losing your mind. Your unconscious mind, I mean.
A lot of our most important thinking happens unconsciously,
our brains churning in the background while our focus is elsewhere,
until the wonderful moment when a thought finally pops into our consciousness,
like Athena in the mind of Zeus.
For me, this usually happens when I’m walking.
For you, it might be in the shower, or when you are sitting with your coffee.
I really like the way that Female Science Professor talks about
&lt;a href=&quot;http://science-professor.blogspot.com/2014/11/this-is-your-brain-on-administration.html&quot;&gt;your brain on administration&lt;/a&gt;.
When you start doing too much administration, the tsunami starts to take
over your unconscious mind, and the wonderful ideas that pop up start to be
about what you can spend a tiny slice of your grant budget on, or
how to phrase that sensitive email, instead of what to write your
next paper about. This is the most terrible danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have now delayed for too long the part of the blog where I explain my
optimistic but wise, surprising but helpful, advice on how
to manage the tsunami. I am afraid that I must report that
the delay didn’t help me come up with any better ideas.
All I can say is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you have many decisions, you must decide quickly.&lt;/em&gt; This is the secret
that good decider-people know that you and I don’t. Me, I like to mull over
things. Then by the time I actually make a decision, I know I’m sure,
so I feel a lot better about it. That’s OK for big decisions, but not so good
for deciding whether you want to meet tomorrow at 1pm or 2pm.
When it doesn’t really matter, wrap up the matter quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn how to partition your time.&lt;/em&gt; Deep thinking requires uninterrupted
blocks of time. These are hard to find, but you must.
I think that the optimal block size varies from person
to person. Some people split things up by day.
You could have “teaching days”, “admin days”, “research days”, and so on.
Some people enforce no-meeting days. Some people will work Sundays,
but only on research.
Some people don’t check email before 4PM.
Some people send lots of emails late at night because they’re tired anyway.
I don’t split things up by day, because I like to do small tasks
when I get tired from concentrating. I make sure to schedule meetings back
to back, to try to keep blocks of time for deeper work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protect the time when you are most creative.&lt;/em&gt; When you go to partition
your time, you’ll want to remember what time of day you are most creative
and have the most energy. That is the time that you need to reserve for
the most creative work. If people often drop by your office — we all love
an open door policy — then this is the time to not &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; in your
office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make good use of odd chunks of time.&lt;/em&gt; As much as we bemoan smartphones,
they shine at this. If you only have 10 minutes until your next meeting,
the tsunami will happily offer you things that take only 10 minutes to do.
To be an effective professor, you need to play Tetris with time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You need a to-do list.&lt;/em&gt; If you know about things you need to do
that aren’t written down, a part of your unconscious will repeat them over
and over, so you don’t forget. You have many more important jobs for
your unconscious mind than that. I like the principles behind the
&lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/gtd-made-simple-why-i-think-internet.html&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done system&lt;/a&gt;
very much, although my practice is distinctly imperfect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find a fast way to schedule meetings.&lt;/em&gt; Really a special case of the first
principle. If you spend 20 hours a week in meetings, it’s easy to spend
a couple hours a week arranging meetings. You need to make arranging a time
as simple as possible, using whatever tools work for you. For example,
I have my Google calendar hooked up to Doodle, so when an administrator
sends out a Doodle poll, I can respond in one click. Some online calendars
have features for creating appointment slots. Some people publish their
free/busy schedule publicly. Whatever works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know when “good enough” is good enough.&lt;/em&gt; The easiest way to get more things
done is to spend less time doing each thing. Your research requires certain
habits of mind, careful and precise thought, perhaps. I guarantee you that
this level of clarity and precision is not required for your emails.
Jenny Pickerill has a nice
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JennyPickerill/status/985780112112091141&quot;&gt;Twitter thread on satisficing&lt;/a&gt;
as a professor.
Satisficing is more painful for tasks that are more central
to our mission. Any university class can be made 20% better at the cost
of twice as much prep time — don’t do it. (I received this advice,
second hand, from an award-winning lecturer!) I’m not saying that
you should be puzzling out your colleague’s slides for the first time
in front of the class, either. You need to find something in the middle,
and the same goes for the service that you do inside and outside
of the university.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

was a fearsome Mafia hitman in New York in the 70s.
According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Pistone&quot;&gt;an undercover FBI agent&lt;/a&gt;
who knew him well, he was smart and savvy in underworld situations.
He could walk into a restaurant where he knew no one,
watch who talked to who, watch how they talked,
and work out who was in the underworld, who received more deference,
whether the restaurant was being extorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other situations, a different story. The FBI agent,
Joseph Pistone, was himself an incredibly perceptive observer
(if he wasn’t, he’d have been murdered). He reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A lot of these wiseguys did not have the ability to move around the country.
Once you got these guys out of New York City, they were like fish out of water....
As they schooled me in the mafia, I had to school them on how to make airline reservations.
I am talking about a 49-year-old man,
telling him how to make airline reservations to three different cities, with an
open return, because we
did not know what date we were going to return to New York City.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption class=&quot;quote-source&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;quote-author&quot;&gt;Joseph Pistone&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;cite class=&quot;quote-title&quot;&gt;Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I was immediately reminded of computer science research.
In research situations, I think of myself as reasonably socially aware:
I have a network of mentors, students, and collaborators;
I can meet new colleagues and have interesting technical discussions;
I can even navigate the occasional difficult conversation when the need
arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But outside of work, I can be a bit more awkward,
or at least that’s what my wife says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stereotype technical people as having low social skills, and
I’ll admit knowing people who fully meet that stereotype.
The Mafia hitman reminds us that social skills are context specific:
you can be savvy in one type of situation, and clueless in another.
“Social skills” aren’t a single skill, any more than intellectual
skills are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the term implies something else. Social skills are skills.
You can learn them.
And it is in the interests of your career to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="social skills" /><category term="painfully extended metaphors" /><summary type="html">Benjamin “Lefty Guns” Ruggiero was a fearsome Mafia hitman in New York in the 70s.

Part III&amp;amp;#58 The Trouble about Freedom</title><link href="http://www.theexclusive.org//2018/05/freedom.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stress in Research. Part III&amp;#58 The Trouble about Freedom" /><published>2018-05-05T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-05-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://www.theexclusive.org//2018/05/freedom</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.theexclusive.org//2018/05/freedom.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third post in what is becoming an increasingly long
series on &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/stress%20in%20research&quot;&gt;stress in research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joked before that there’s no reason researchers should feel stress:
how stressful can a job be if you’re not expected to roll in to work until 10
o’clock in the morning? But more seriously, this
flexibility is itself a source of stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academics don’t really have bosses, despite what our
senior leadership sometimes seem to think. We do have a head
of department, of course, but the relationship isn’t
like having a supervisor. I don’t have weekly meetings
with my department head to report my progress on my current
projects. And I would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; go to my head of department and say I’ve got too much to do, can she tell me
how I should prioritize my workload so that I focus on tasks
that are most important to the University.
The very idea is laughable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of having a boss, we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pgbovine.net/why-academics-feel-overworked.htm&quot;&gt;sources of work&lt;/a&gt;. Students from our own university and around the world ask us if we
can supervise their research projects. We
review and comment on reports from our own students.
We are asked to evaluate finished PhD theses from students
at other universities, in our own country
and worldwide.
 Funding agencies from our country and others ask
us to review proposals for multi-million pound research projects.
Representatives from the government ask us
to discuss connections with problems of national interest.
We organize workshops and conferences.
We meet researchers in other universities and governments
to learn about their work and explore potential collaborations.
The great thing about the blog I just linked to
— it is actually called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pgbovine.net/why-academics-feel-overworked.htm&quot;&gt;why academics feel overworked&lt;/a&gt; — is that it tries to make a complete
list of where academic work comes from.
My list just above is incomplete
because I’m only mentioning things that I can remember
happening in the past week. (And this, with me
 on sabbatical;
I’m not teaching this year.)
All of these sources of work are people who are asking
politely for our help on important work of their own.
None of these sources of work know about each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful, of course it is important to learn to say “no”, and to learn to say “no” often.
There are tricks about how to say “no” better, in a way
that helps the person who have asked. Many other blogs
talk about that, so I won’t go further now.
It’s enough to say that even if you say “no” a lot,
you will still have a lot to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I want to talk about flexibility.
It’s no surprise that having a lot to do creates stress.
But having the flexibility to choose what to do
also creates stress.
The problem is that flexibility creates guilt.
Suppose I have tasks A, B, C, and D to do — too many — and
my boss instructs me to prioritize C, even though I think A
is more important. I might be annoyed or dismayed
by a poor decision being made, but I’m not &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt;
for the poor decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; prioritize, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; responsible.
When I choose to do one thing, I’m keenly aware
that there are many other things that I could be doing,
behind each a person who would like a few minutes
(or a few hours) of my help. For every thing I choose to do,
there are other people that I feel like I am letting down.
I am never quite
sure if the thing I have chosen to do is the right one.
Sometimes I’m quite sure that the thing that I’m doing
is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the most important, but maybe simply the most
important that I have enough energy for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is the flexibility necessary?
Why couldn’t academic work and research work be managed
more directly, like other types of work?
Our situation is not as unusual as it may seem —
in any career, the more senior you become, the more
you are expected to set the agenda rather than follow an
agenda that is given to you. In academia and research specifically, there are
two forces that mandate flexibility for good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first: If you do not have freedom to prioritize,
you do not have intellectual freedom, because part of intellectual
freedom is deciding what to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second: The job
of a researcher is about creating positive externalities.
Our work is to perpetuate and create a large portion
of human knowledge. When we succeed, the value of our work is enjoyed
by society as a whole, rather than the institution
that employs us. This is why the idea of going to my department
head for advice on prioritizing is so laughable.
We cannot ask the institution what is most valuable, because so much of the
value that we create does not return to the institution.
You become an academic because you believe the specialized
knowledge that fascinates you has, in some small sense,
importance to society as a whole. Another responsibility,
and another stressor!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="stress in research" /><summary type="html">The third post in what is becoming an increasingly long series on stress in research.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stress in Research. Part II&amp;amp;#58 Research Worth and Self-Worth</title><link href="http://www.theexclusive.org//2018/04/worth.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stress in Research.

&lt;a href=&quot;/tag/stress%20in%20research&quot;&gt;series on stress in research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be surprising, but one of the main sources of stress in research is self-esteem.
It’s so common and tempting to think of career success as a measure of one’s moral worth as a person. Stated so bluntly, it sounds like the silliest thing in the world to believe, yet I expect that we have all, at least at times, at least unconsciously, fallen into this trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source of this trap is cognitive dissonance, and the danger of the trap is that research is a roller coaster. Every researcher has days when they’ve had some good success, and they feel on top of the world. To resolve the cognitive dissonance, you feel that because you’re happy about one thing, you’re happy about everything. Your career is going well, your personal life is going well, you’re just a good person all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know what they say about what goes up. There will always be weeks and months when experiments don’t work, when paper submissions and job applications are rejected, several in a row. Then the emotional effects can hit hard. Nobody likes having a frustrating time in their research. But if you conflate research worth with self-worth, if you tell yourself that the main way that your life will contribute to the world is by your groundbreaking work, then when your research is going poorly, you feel like a failure in life. Not for nothing has it been observed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/academics-face-higher-mental-health-risk-than-other-professions&quot;&gt;that academics face relatively high mental health risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we avoid the trap of conflating your colleagues’ respect for you as a researcher with your own self-respect as a human being? For what it’s worth, I’d expect that this trap occurs in all of the creative professions. Indeed, as much as academics like to think of ourselves as unique creatures, none of the sources of stress in research are unique to the job of research. Perhaps that is a topic for another time, but it does not help us here: Knowing that our stress is shared is not alone enough to relieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another blog might tell you: Keep a professional distance. The way to  avoid conflating your research success to your self-worth is to think of research as a job rather than a calling. But that’s not the advice that I will give, because if you want to do good work, sometimes you need
to take things personally. As the great Captain says, sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzJAebfEIg&quot;&gt;you need your pain&lt;/a&gt;. So I’ll ask the question differently.
How do we keep our passion for research without harming our mental health?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mental tricks that work a bit for me, may not work for you. So I’ll list a
few different mental strategies, strategies for self-talk — those who know me
will know that I am a big fan of talking to myself — that you can experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One strategy is to focus on the fun, for example, by treating a tenure-track faculty job &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/&quot;&gt;like a seven-year postdoc&lt;/a&gt;. Richard Feynman has a wonderful story about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~kilcup/262/feynman.html&quot;&gt;recapturing fun in his research&lt;/a&gt;. One always wonders if Feynman’s stories are exaggerated, but the principle of countering stress by fun is surely sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good strategy is to have backup sources of self-worth. Academic jobs are naturally set up this way. Even if no one reads my papers the minute after I die, or frankly, the minute after they’re written, I’ve still taught hundreds of students about fundamental knowledge that has helped them, if only a little. That’s another source of professional self-worth. Or of course, one can seek self-worth from being a good child, parent, spouse, sibling, and friend. Both of these — teaching and family — are instances of a more general point. &lt;em&gt;We should find worth in our relationships with other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is simply to have truly excessive reserves of self-confidence, so that whenever the roller coaster goes down, you can tell yourself with absolute conviction that the roller coaster will go up again, because by god you are brilliant enough to push it up again all by yourself. I know I’m making this sound ridiculous, but I’ve read an interview with a Nobelist who basically said that lots of other people doubted him, but he never doubted himself. Whether it was bravado or truth I don’t know, but hey, if it works for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final strategy of which I’m personally fond. I firmly believe that one of the most important mental
abilities in life, one that to the great detriment of our world few people master, is to learn to believe contradictory things. One of the many lovely details of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kingkiller_Chronicle&quot;&gt;the Kingkiller Chronicles&lt;/a&gt;
is that there is a type of magic that depends on &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingkiller.wikia.com/wiki/Sympathy&quot;&gt;having a will strong
enough to believe contradictory things simultaneously&lt;/a&gt;.
Back in this world, almost all statements
are sometimes true and sometimes false. The same is true in research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of embracing a noble contradiction: I do believe that, if you want to be
effective as a researcher, work needs to be the most important thing to you
&lt;em&gt;during the time that you are working&lt;/em&gt;.
Creative work really does require complete focus. But there is no need
to maintain this belief while you are not working. During those times, you can understand
that most research work comes to nothing, and that is no waste as long as some
small fraction of the research in the world makes a large enough difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: Because our careers require so much time and passion, it’s natural that professional colleagues sometimes become personal friends. This means that  I think it’s important to be able to value someone as a friend, even if you do not particularly care for their research.
Stated plainly, this is obvious — how could it be otherwise? — but it’s so
easy to be confused into thinking that once you admire one aspect of someone,
that you like everything about them.
Again, this is a confusion that arises from cognitive dissonance.
It requires conscious effort to be able to separate your admiration or criticism of someone’s work with your admiration (or lack thereof!) of them as a trustworthy, loyal friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I’ve learned to do that, perhaps I can extend the same courtesy to myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="stress in research" /><summary type="html">The second post in what is perhaps a series on stress in research.</summary></entry></feed>
