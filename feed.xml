None of them work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many years of trying, I’ve come to the conclusion that the Gmail solution of “put all the email in one bucket and search” is the way to go. Over the years I have gotten very, very good at searching my email. But that’s a topic for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I wanted to mention a special email folder that I have. Maybe it’s the most important folder I have, even though I might only look at it once a year, if that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could be so special? Emails to pick me up when I’m feeling down. You know which ones I mean. The emails that contained job offers, promotions, grant awards, or even just kind words from trusted senior colleagues. I archive emails like this, emails with special professional successes, in their own folder. Then every once in a while, if I’ve been dealing with a difficult situation or am having a particularly bad bout of impostor syndrome, I can open up the folder and look at it just for a minute, and then I feel a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might ask why these are &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; emails. Hopefully I’ve had happy things happen in my personal life as well? Don’t be too worried. It’s just that my personal life doesn’t usually happen over email. That’s what my wedding photos are for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this idea from a blog post somewhere by some other professor, but I don’t remember who or where. If you do, please let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="email" /><summary type="html">I’ve tried a lot of different methods to organize my email.

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to start from two assumptions:
&lt;em&gt;double blind reviewing is good&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;prepublication is good.&lt;/em&gt; 
You can disagree with either assumption, or you could think that double-blind
is so much more important than than prepublication that it should
be preserved at all costs, or vice versa. People hold all of those views,
and it would take an even longer post to pull all that apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’d to think about how to reconcile these two assumptions, because I do believe them both, and how to obtain an engineering trade-off that aims at most of the advantages of both, most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have said that allowing papers to be prepublished anonymously would be a good compromise. An appealing idea, but
I worry that it may be
a bad one. Instead, I’ll argue that a good compromise is this:  Accept that papers will be de-blinded, but design the double-blind review process to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the underlying point is that the conflict isn’t black and white. For double blind to work, it’s not necessary for 100% of the submissions to be unblind&lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., have their author identities be undiscoverable online. I might even suggest that it’s possible to have effective double blind when &lt;em&gt;all author identities&lt;/em&gt; are available online. Just because a paper is unblind&lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; does not mean that the reviewers are unblind&lt;em&gt;ed&lt;/em&gt; — perhaps they have not seen it, or perhaps they saw it in an email with 100 other papers and don’t remember having seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-shouldnt-we-do&quot;&gt;What shouldn’t we do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some recommendations that I’ve seen that unfortunately I don’t think will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anti-recommendation-1-i-know-lets-have-an-anonymous-version-of-arxiv&quot;&gt;Anti-Recommendation 1: I know. Let’s have an anonymous version of arxiv.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people have suggested allowing authors to prepublish papers
anonymously (incidentally, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mhhe.com/math/calc/smithminton2e/cd/tools/timeline/bernoulli_1.html&quot;&gt;amusing precendents for this&lt;/a&gt; in the history of mathematics). This could be implemented via an overlay of arxiv, or a new feature added to arxiv itself, that would allow authors to temporary hide their identity. Let’s call this AnonArxiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submissions to AnonArxiv would be immediately available to all but without the author names. Then, once the paper is accepted, AnonArxiv would reveal the author names, while preserving the time stamp of the anonymous submission. The conference would then require that if submissions are prepublished, they must be prepublished anonymously; any other prepublished submissions will be rejected without review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think this was a cool idea. Now I don’t. It neglects a 
fundamental principle that we are sadly all familiar with,
that &lt;em&gt;most papers are rejected&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I post a great paper to AnonArxiv and submit it to ACL. Like most papers it is rejected. I’m convinced that the reviewers have made a mistake, and so I want to resubmit it to EMNLP. How do we handle this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could (1) require resubmissions to remain anonymous. After rejection, I must choose whether to unblind the submission on AnonArxiv, in which case it cannot be resubmitted to other conferences, or whether to keep the submission anonymous, in which case the paper could spend a year-plus as anonymous, until it is finally accepted. This seems an unreasonable choice to force onto authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or we could (2) allow authors, after one rejection, to unblind their AnonArxiv submissions and resubmit to a future conference. This has the benefit that papers only spend a few months as public-but-anonymous, which is not so bad.
But I’m not sure it works. For one, this is difficult to enforce, because apart from the honor system, the information about whether a paper was previously submitted is confidential (keep in mind that the original submission might have been outside the NLP community). But more fundamentally, what would we do for first-time submissions that violate this rule, reject them without review? How would we justify doing that when there are many second-time submissions whose authors are already public?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would also mean that if I submit a paper to a conference outside of NLP which allows prepublication and get rejected, I would not be able subsequently decide that an NLP conference would be a better fit, and resubmit there. It might be possible to implement a special dispensation in this case, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some regret, I come to the conclusion that AnonArxiv won’t work. That said, AnonArxiv variant (2) might work if a large enough percentage of submissions were first time submits. Then we’d have the majority of the papers on AnonArxiv, and hence unblindable, which might be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perhaps-anti-recommendation-require-prepublication-to-be-declared&quot;&gt;Perhaps Anti-Recommendation: Require prepublication to be declared&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACL 2017 required all submissions to &lt;a href=&quot;http://acl2017.org/calls/papers/#multiple-submission-policy&quot;&gt;declare if they had been prepublished&lt;/a&gt;. Reviewers were notified that a paper had been prepublished. Prepublished papers that were not declared as such were summarily rejected. Unfortunately I don’t understand the rationale for how this stringent requirement was meant to help. Remember, the goal is not to prevent all papers from being unblind-&lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt;, it’s to prevent too many papers from being unblind-&lt;em&gt;ed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a good idea if the hope is to warn reviewers that they should be careful about searching the web for the paper’s title during the review process. The problem with this idea though, is that it does not help if the authors very reasonable prepublish the paper just &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; submission. So really, all reviewers need to be careful, all the time, and the extra heads up maybe isn’t too helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the idea was to simply to gain more information about how many papers are prepublished, then I totally agree with asking the question, but I do not see why penalties for non-compliance were necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the idea was to handle prepublished papers differently in the review process than non-prepublished ones, then I am not sure why this is necessary. Instead, I’ll advocate below that we handle the review process of &lt;em&gt;unblinded&lt;/em&gt; papers differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I would argue that it might make sense for conferences to request that authors declare prepublication, but that no penalties for noncompliance be used in future years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendation-but-thats-actually-an-orthogonal-issue-lets-use-openreviewnet&quot;&gt;Recommendation-But-That’s-Actually-An-Orthogonal-Issue: Let’s use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openreview.net&quot;&gt;OpenReview.Net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also read the suggestion that the NLP community switch to running conferences on OpenReview. I love OpenReview, and I eagerly await the day when I can go onto a site like OpenReview and pull up any paper in computer science, from any venue, from any year past or present, and find a lively and informative discussion online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But OpenReview is a software platform, not a reviewing process. It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://openreview.net/pdf?id=xf0zSBd2iufMg&quot;&gt;specifically designed&lt;/a&gt; to allow conference chairs to configure what information about the reviews and authors should be made public and when. It’s not designed to answer the policy questions about whether submissions should be anonymous and what happens after they are rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-right-wise-guy-so-&quot;&gt;All right, wise guy, so …?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to square the circle is to try adapting reviewing norms to adjust and compensate for the fact that it is more likely for papers to be unblinded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conferences are already doing these things, so I don’t claim to have any new ideas. But I think it’s useful to bring together the arguments for these ideas, rather than having programme chairs have to reconstruct these arguments for themselves every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendation-1-clarify-norms-for-reviewers&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Clarify Norms for Reviewers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the author information for all submissions are public online, then reviewers, area chairs, and programme chairs can take steps to reduce the chances that a submission is unblinded, and to minimize the consequences when one is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewers&lt;/strong&gt; should avoid making Web searches that would be likely to reveal the authors of the paper. It can often happen that a well-meaning search for related work inadvertently turns up an unblinded copy of the paper. I am not saying that reviewers should never search for related work, but it carries risks — it always has (ten years ago I had a reviewer of one of my papers deblinded by a tech report) — and reviewers should try to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the reviewer feels that a Web search is necessary, they should hold off until they have read the paper completely and formed an initial impression of it. This allows reviewers to apply the bias of cognitive dissonance to counteract the potential bias of unblinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If reviewers learn the author identities, then they must let the relevant person — who could variously go by the title “programme chair”, “programme committee member”, “meta-reviewer”, “senior PC member”, “area chair”, etc; I’ll use the term “area chair” (AC) — know this right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Area chairs&lt;/strong&gt; should be prepared to apply their judgment to weigh the reviewers’ comments differently when some reviewers are unblinded. Consider a paper like this: it has two negative reviews and one positive review, but the positive reviewer has been unblinded, the paper comes from a famous group so there is possibility of unconscious bias, and the AC believes that the negative comments have merit. Then the AC should be prepared to give less weight to the positive reviewer. In other examples, perhaps all three reviews are positive, or the authors are lesser-known, and so unlikely to engender positive bias. Then downweighting unblinded reviewers may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programme chairs&lt;/strong&gt; should carefully write their instructions to reviewers and area chairs to make these expectations clear. They should also be prepared to assist ACs with borderline cases where there is possibility of bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t know if these steps alone will reduce the percentage of unblind-&lt;em&gt;ed&lt;/em&gt; submissions to an acceptable level. For example, if the percentage of unblinded reviews reaches, say, 80%, this recommendation becomes more like a band-aid that would be unlikely to preserve the benefits of double-blind review. Which brings us to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendation-2-measure-and-monitor&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Measure and Monitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the heat around this discussion may be because we are, as it were, debating in the blind. It is not difficult to gather more evidence than we have now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should be able to measure and publicize the percentage of submissions and accepted papers which are prepublished.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although a bit more delicate, we should be able to estimate the percentage of submissions which are not first time submits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we follow recommendation 1, we should also be able to monitor the percentage of reviews which are unblinded and the percentage of submissions which have had 1, 2, or 3 unblinded reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We should also attempt to record measures of diversity in the accepted papers in terms of authors and institutions. We should keep tracking those measures, monitor for decreases, and the presumed negative correlation with percentage of unblindedness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

How light? Depends how well you pack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot of frequent air travelers say that you should never check bags if you can avoid it, but I think it’s not always clear cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do usually travel with only a carry on. This has a lot of advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need to queue at the ticket counter to drop off bags. If you’ve checked in online, using your phone is easiest but printing your boarding pass is still good, then you can go straight to security and the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need to wait at baggage claim on arrival. This is an especially big win if you are arriving late at night.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easier to switch flights at the last minute. You might wonder why you’d want to do this if you’ve planned ahead. You’ll stop wondering when your first flight arrives early and you wish you could jump on an earlier connecting flight. Or when your first flight is delayed but you still have a chance to catch a different connecting flight. I’m still annoyed at the time United Airlines prevented me from doing this by checking my bag at the gate unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that said, for some trips it can be more convenient to check your bags, even if you could squeeze into a smaller bag. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can bring a bigger bag that holds more. (duh)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need to lug the bag around the airport. This removes stress during a long connection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can fill up your checked bag with liquids and gels. This is especially useful if you’d like to bring gifts of food and drink back to your friends, family, or perhaps to a select group of academic bloggers who you particularly admire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are running a few minutes late to the gate, the plane is more likely to wait for you, because if they don’t, they need to find and remove your bag from the hold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For direct flights I think it’s clear that carry on wins most of the time, but if you have a connection then it may well depend on your itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="travel tips" /><summary type="html">This time, some advice of a lighter sort.

When people ask you a important and difficult question like this, usually the best thing is to think of someone else who can give a better answer than you. For time management, an obvious person to turn to is the late Randy Pausch, a noted computer scientist who became an internet sensation because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/book/&quot;&gt;an inspirational lecture&lt;/a&gt; that he gave after he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to recommend a different, more practical, and excellent lecture that he gave on time management:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0&quot;&gt;Video of Randy Pausch’s lecture on time management&lt;/a&gt; (1 hour, 15 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf&quot;&gt;Slides of lecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stafforini.com/blog/summary-of-time-management-by-randy-pausch/&quot;&gt;Summary of ‘Time management’, by Randy Pausch&lt;/a&gt;. Bullet points written by Pablo Stafforini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should start by watching the lecture. I found it helpful to have the slides and bullet points in separate windows on screen as I watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need further encouragement to watch the lecture, I can say
that what amazed me, as poor at time management as I may be, was the number of suggestions
that I actually use day-to-day. I had entirely forgotten just how much I had learned the first time I saw this material. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find your most creative time of day and defend it ruthlessly. The most important tip that you can learn for creative work. (I was interested to learn later that your most creative time can actually change over the years.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn off your email notification sound. Do it now!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn ways to say “no” gently. It makes saying “no” easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t ever delete emails. Search instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep a todo list and calendar. My today-self says, “Well, duh.” But there was a time when I didn’t. You should start now!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get a speakerphone so that you can get other things done while on hold with customer serve. Now, mobile phones or even Skype has a speakerphone option that works for this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professors should keep Kleenex in their office. Yes, we all need this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping a clock on the wall behind where your visitors sit. Much less obtrusive than a wristwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write down one-minute minutes. So helpful! Just the main takeaways and actions for next time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep a time clock. A big topic that I hope to write more about later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also an equally long list of good advice that I had forgotten, but for that, you’ll need to watch the lecture yourself!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="productivity" /><category term="time management" /><summary type="html">Several students have recently asked me for advice about time management.

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t feel like I’ve been blogging that long. Perhaps that’s because I post only once every few years. If you like the blog (and if you don’t — why would you read a post like this???), you’ll be happy to know that I’ll be posting more often in the coming year. I’ve found a posting rhythm that works for me: write all my posts at once while I’m on holiday, and queue them up for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy I started doing this. I often mention my posts when my students ask me for advice, which has the benefit that my students get tired of hearing about the blog, and therefore stop wanting to meet with me. This leaves my students with more time to carry out excellent research, while leaving me with more time to play old versions of Minesweeper. Everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any regrets? Perhaps only that I wish I could write more silly posts like &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/02/a-suggestion-for-scotland.html&quot;&gt;my manifesto on the political future of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, but real-life politics have grown dark enough that I find myself unable to summon the spirit of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even without fun, I have lots of ideas for posts about career advice and about the academic and research enterprises. So this will probably be that kind of blog for a wee while longer. It’s fascinating how the theme and how the tone of a blog evolves. I had some ideas about what the blog would be like when I started, but the more I continued, the more I found the blog grow into something different than I expected. Much like life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can guarantee (disclaimer: this is not a legal guarantee) is that the blog will continue to be reflective and introspective, and that if you’ve liked it so far, you’ll probably like what’s coming next.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="metablog" /><summary type="html">I don’t like to write about the blog on the blog, because that seems silly and self-indulgent, but I can’t help noticing that today is the five year anniversary of my first blog post.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Context switching</title><link href="http://www.theexclusive.org//2017/07/context-switching.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Context switching" /><published>2017-07-01T19:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-07-01T19:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://www.theexclusive.org//2017/07/context-switching</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://www.theexclusive.org//2017/07/context-switching.html">&lt;p&gt;Of the many quirks shared by computer scientists, one that has somewhat entered the popular culture is the use of computing metaphors to speak about how we think. For example, “multitasking” is actually a technical term invented by computer scientists &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking&quot;&gt;in the 1960s&lt;/a&gt; to describe the way a computer pretends to execute many programs at once, even if in reality it can only do one thing at a time. You can see why the term would have been quickly co-opted to metaphorically describe humans who attempt the same trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the benefit of the three or four readers of the blog who are not computer scientists, I’ll digress here in order to comment that the situation on the computing side has gotten more complicated since the 60s, as almost all modern computers can perform many operations at once, but they still use multitasking so that they can pretend to do even more. That probably sounds like some people you know, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional computer scientists have many more metaphors at their command, though. We speak of “swapping in” and “swapping out” the details of a project from our short-term memories, referring to a technique that allows computers to pretend to have infinitely large memories. We also — and now I come finally to the topic of the post — talk about “context switching”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A context switch is a necessary result of multitasking. If a computer is pretending to run ten programs at once when it can in reality run only one, then it must switch very quickly back and forth between them, like a chef switching between stirring the sauce and browning the meat. Unlike the chef, on a computer the switching comes with a price. The price comes because computers have many different types of memory, some fast and close to the CPU, others larger and farther away.  Every time the computer switches from one program to another, it has to move data about the old program out of the small fast memory, and move the new data in. The work of switching back and forth is what we call context switching. It takes a bit of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is in your mind. When you switch between different tasks, it takes a while to remember the other context: what it was that you were supposed to be doing on the new task, why you thought it was a good idea, and so on. This is why you’re not as efficient when you first start a new task as when you’ve been thinking about it for a while. This has led to the deluge of self-help articles, some of which I’m sure you’ve seen, about how mental multitasking is a bad idea. It takes time to switch contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a professor &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theexclusive.org/2013/08/academic-ranks-in-us-and-uk.html&quot;&gt;in the US sense&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;, especially leading a research group, context switching cannot be avoided. The nature of the job requires us to make progress on many different types of tasks each day, from answering a student question about a problem set, to planning for the curriculum next year, to reading a paper related to one research project, to an impromptu meeting with a colleague about faculty hiring for next spring, to a scheduled meeting with a PhD student about a different research project. One of my mentors liked to joke, “Professors are stateless” (another computing metaphor). The reason that we seem stateless is that it takes some time for us to remember the previous context. Not only does it take time to context switch, but it is also a bit disorienting. A colleague once told me that the part of being a professor that they disliked the most was having to context switch many times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People sometimes ask me how I handle context switching. I have a few strategies. One is a bit embarrassing, but I will tell you anyway. Perhaps I made this a long post to drive people away before I revealed the embarrassing one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First is not to be afraid to ask questions. This is useful in one-to-one student meetings about a research project. You can say something like: “Sorry, what was the vorpal sort for again?” Of course, if you do this too much, you derail the meeting. But with practice I found that much of the time, simply asking the question silently in my head was enough. Once I had articulated the question clearly, I was able remember the answer, without bothering the student to repeat what we had already discussed. I’m sure this makes me look smarter, but more importantly it saves time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep relevant information easy to search on my computer. This is why I am never without my laptop. I don’t try to remember all that I need to know so much as remember how to find it in my email, in my Evernote, by a Web search that I know will bring up a particular page, or whatever. Then if I’m in a large meeting, for example, where I can’t just stop and ask twenty people to remind me what they said in last week’s meeting, I can search quietly and find the context I need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I know I’ll need to make a big context switch, I’ll take a break to clear my head. A ten-minute walk helps, or staring out a window, or something sweet. Coffee doesn’t work here for me; it’s great for energy, of course, but not for context switching.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I write something down, I know down to my unconscious that it’s OK to stop thinking about it, because now I can come back later. When I have meetings back to back, during the second meeting I might remember something I should have said in the first. If I quickly jot down a note, that helps me to stop thinking about the first meeting, and return to the task at hand. This works within meetings too. Sometimes I think of something that I need to say in a one-on-one meeting, but it’s not as important as what we’re talking about right now. I’ll write that down too. I’ll even say something as I’m doing this, so we both know there’s something to come back to later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, OK, I’ll tell you the embarrassing one. I have some mental imagery that I use. I imagine my focus of attention as the beam of light coming from a huge lamp, like at the top of the lighthouse. When I need to switch focus quickly, like between back to back meetings, I imagine myself grasping the lamp between my hands — it’s several feet around, and heavy, so this takes a real effort — and slowly rotating it to shine onto the new problem that I’m meant to be thinking about. Believe it or not, sometimes this works. I will never tell you when I am doing this, even if you ask.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

He is revered not only for the many championships he has won, or even for his daring
and distinctive style, but also for his insightful and even witty commentary on the games
of other professionals. All of us who attended expected a once-in-a-lifetime treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it was, but not in the way we expected.
Sadly, the translation was not of the same standard as the lecture.
As best as I can recall, the translation included such wisdom
as: “You should play on the points where you want to play”,
“Sometimes you may not want to play where you play, but still
it is important to play where you want to play”,
and “It is important to review the game after it is finished”.
All of us in the audience looked at each other blankly.
None of us could understand how this could be the accumulated wisdom
of a brilliant lecturer and champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confused, I found a friend who understood the lecture in its original language.
A pained look on his face, my friend explained that the flowery and poetic language
of the lecture would have been difficult even for an professional translator,
let alone a foreign Go enthusiast, however fluent, graciously donating his time
to translate. My friend then explained the
gist of the lecture, and indeed it contained great wisdom about how to learn the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you play Go, there’s a move on the board that you
desperately wish to play.  I’m not talking about moves that are
obviously good, those that claim large territories or capture many
stones. Everybody likes to do that.  But sometimes,
a point on the board calls out, like a tiny but brilliant beam of starlight
is shining on one intersection of all the 361 on the board. But in your
conscious mind, you cannot explain why that move. Hard as you may try,
the move is too complex to read out, and you’re not sure what will
happen. A player of your strength does not play only on gut feeling, without thinking. It
seems too dangerous. You should play somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what the Go master said is: When a point on the board calls to you like this,
you must play there. Not because the move is correct — it almost certainly is not —
but because your intuition is telling you that the move is correct,
so the only way to improve your intuition is to play the move,
in the hope that by so doing, you may discover why it is wrong.
Go is too complex for people to understand all consequences in advance,
so at some point, no matter how far you look ahead, you have only your own intuition to trust.
This is why you also must review your own games afterwards, when the result is more clear.
The only way to train your intuition is follow it, understand the consequences,
and correct where you were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research is like this. There is a feeling that I have learned to recognize when an idea
is waiting to form,  but I cannot yet  articulate it. Whenever I have this
feeling, I shut up and wait, until the words come. Usually, after I do find
the words and formulae to express my thought, it becomes clear that the idea is bad,  has
been already published, or — most commonly — both. But it is not important that the
idea be often good, because in research
the overall success of your career depends not on the worth of your typical idea,
but of your best idea.
When your unconscious mind is repeatedly telling you to go somewhere,
sometimes that alone is reason to Go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="advice" /><category term="go the game" /><category term="how to think" /><category term="painfully extended metaphors" /><summary type="html">Years ago I attended a lecture from a famous master of the game of Go.

I created a “companion web site” for the talk, which is an online handout including slides, code, links to papers, and a bullet-point abstract. Here’s my &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/talks/nampi2016-talk-sutton/&quot;&gt;first try at an online handout.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/powerpoint&quot;&gt;Tufte’s quixotic diatribe against Powerpoint&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends written handouts instead of slides. The web site is an attempt to adapt his idea to an all-open all-Internet all-the-time age. Seeing as I have no intention of printing out several hundred paper copies of a handout and carrying them thousands of miles to a research meeting, and that most people have laptops anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the handout? Lectures are limited because speech is linear. If we are conversing, when I haven’t understood what you have said, I can ask you to go back. When you lecture, I cannot do that. If I stop a moment to think more deeply about something that you have said, I run the risk of missing your next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handout is designed to help with this. By giving you a written summary, and also my slides, you can “go back” and re-read a point that you may have missed. A second role for the online handout is to help you find more details after the talk, to find exactly which papers, which code, and so on, I was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the handout really helps, then it raises an even more interesting question. Why the slides?
Tufte argues vehemently against slides as a replacement for written text. Slides have low resolution, which encourages poor statistical graphics, and encourages hiding details which are vital to assessing an argument in science and engineering. Also, most arguments do not fit into bullet points, because bullet points can convey only linear relationships and nesting. The narrative that you are trying to convey in your talk is likely to be more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In research conferences, we already have a handout for each of our talks, the research paper. So maybe we be presenting scientific talks with no slides at all? If not, why not? Sometimes at a conference, I’ll skim the paper during the talk if I am starting to get confused. Sometimes that helps. But papers are information dense, with long sentences full of qualifying statements designed to forestall potential reviewer criticisms. It can be hard to read dense text while also remaining aware about what the speaker is currently saying. Sometimes I think this a blind spot of Tufte’s, that he leans too heavily on information density as a measure of the quality of a display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can think of the sequence [ slides, audio of talk, online handout, paper ] as attempting to convey the same information at different levels of density. This allows the reader/viewer to choose the appropriate level. But slides and audio are both low density. Do we really need two low density ways of conveying the information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of asking the question is: What are slides good for, when they are good? Tufte does seem to accept that good slides are possible. He admits that perhaps the top 10% of presenters aren’t harmed by Powerpoint’s cognitive style, as their own presenting style is strongly enough developed that they impose it on the software, affordances be damned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of years, I’ve been experimenting with different slide designs. I may even starting to understand what principles I am aiming at in my slide designs. But I think that’s a topic for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="philosophy of powerpoint" /><category term="presenting" /><summary type="html">My last research talk, I tried an experiment during the talk.

(Then more stuff comes and I get disorganised again.) The way I get organized is by attempting to follow a system called GTD. GTD comes from a book by David Allen called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0349408947&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt;. The book is an unusual read, a mix of management-speak, Zen-speak, and tips for organizing your filing cabinet. But for all that, it’s a good book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GTD has become popular with many different types of people. It is especially popular with tech people on the Internet. It’s a bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2007/09/ff-allen/&quot;&gt;a geek cult&lt;/a&gt;, which is strange. Why are computer programmers singing praises for a management consultant? Indeed, why are university professors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people on the Internet have been writing about GTD. It can be hard to get started. For one, the book itself, the writing isn’t always succinct. Also, cleaning up your to do list and blogging about it is a good way to procrastinate. So, there are lots of blog posts out there about GTD. Lots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to figure out a way to explain GTD that makes clear how simple it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you need a to do list. It will clear your head so that you can concentrate on your work. That’s it. That’s GTD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you’ve tried this already. It helped for a little bit, but then it stopped helping. This is where GTD gets interesting. It’s based on an extraordinarily perceptive understanding of why to do lists stop working. They can stop working because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You haven’t written everything down.&lt;/em&gt; To do lists become way better when they contain literally everything that you have to do in life. If they don’t, then deep down in your mind, you will always know that you’ve got stuff to do that isn’t written down, so you spend mental focus trying to remember those things. It’s like if you tried to keep a calendar but only wrote down half of your appointments in it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your list is too vague.&lt;/em&gt; If you write down something like “Dentist” on your to do list, every time you see it, you need a little mental energy to work out what that meant and plan what you need to do about it. But after you’ve done that planning, you don’t &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything about it, because you were just scanning your to do list and right now you need to do something else instead. This makes you anxious. And if you read “Dentist” without taking that effort, then you still feel anxious because it reminds you that there’s something you need to do and you’re not sure what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your list is too long.&lt;/em&gt; When you’re not sure what to do, you need to be able to scan your list quickly to decide what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t find items right when you need them.&lt;/em&gt; If you’re about to drive past the hardware store, you need to be able to stop in the parking lot and quickly find the list of stuff that you’d been meaning to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can’t write down items right when you think of them.&lt;/em&gt; When you notice you’re running low on toilet paper, you’re not usually in the grocery store at the time. But you still want to record this right then, so you don’t have to remember it until you’re walking past the shop the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your list doesn’t keep up with your life.&lt;/em&gt; Gradually you get more and more things to do that just don’t make it on to your list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t compare your list to your bigger goals.&lt;/em&gt; Urgent things aren’t always important, and it’s easy to let days slip by you. You need to think about what’s most important in your career and your life, and your to do list needs to contain actions that help make the important things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GTD is a system for keeping lists that is designed to avoid these problems. GTD doesn’t care where you keep your lists or how you store them — this is why geeks love GTD, so that they can keep arguing about what software is best. But you don’t need software. Paper works fine. What you need are principles to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main principles of GTD are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Record everything.&lt;/em&gt; Everything that you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Record everywhere.&lt;/em&gt; No matter where you are, you need a way to write things down so that they will end up on your list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organize by context.&lt;/em&gt; You want multiple to do lists, organized so that when you scan a list, it contains only things that you could do right then, if you decided to. You might have a list of people you need to call, a list of things to do at a computer, a list of things to do at home, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specific measurable actions.&lt;/em&gt; This the caveat to “record everything”. If it goes on your list, it needs to be something specific, that you could do right away, finish, and tick off. Instead of writing “Dentist”, you should write, “Email Morag to ask for dentist recommendations”. When you read an item on your list, you don’t want to think “Oh, what was that?” — you want to think “Ah, I can do that!”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small specific projects.&lt;/em&gt; A project is anything that takes multiple specific actions to accomplish, even if it’s only 2 or 3.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plan naturally.&lt;/em&gt; For any project, work out what you need to do on the sheet of paper, and add to your list the actions that you can do right away. Actions that you need to do later down the line, they don’t go on your list.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review weekly.&lt;/em&gt; Check your calendar and your notes to see if there’s anything that you need to do that you haven’t written down yet. Think about your longer term projects and goals and make sure your lists have actions that help with them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you organise a set of lists, and supporting files, to meet these principles, that’s what the book is about. It may not always seem so from the surface, but the book is full of clever little tricks. That’s another reason why the book can be deceptive: It’s easy to admire the tricks but not understand the system. But if you really understand the principles, then the practice becomes much more clear.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="productivity" /><summary type="html">I’m naturally disorganised, but I have so much stuff to do that out of necessity I get organized.

A simple example is the old advice to notice the time of day when you have the most energy, and reserve that time for the most creative aspects of your work. But there are many more examples of this, if you look for them. It helps to be a bit self absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One habit that I’ve just recently reflected on is that sometimes I close my eyes and scrunch my face into an “I’m thinking hard” face when I’m trying to think hard. In some sense this is an affectation. But I like to think that the goal is more noble, to harness the cognitive dissonance that would result if I make the scrunchy face without thinking hard. To escape this dissonance, the only option for my subconscious is to actually start thinking hard. It feels like this helps, at least sometimes, but I haven’t kept careful records. And at least everyone else can see how hard I’m thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Charles Sutton</name></author><category term="stupid brain tricks" /><summary type="html">An important skill in any type of creative work is to observe and reflect on your own habits of thought and discover a way of working that suits them.
