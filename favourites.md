title: My Favourite Posts!
---

Welcome! I've been writing this blog, once in a while, for a long time. 
Perhaps you would like some suggestions for where to start.

Here are two series of posts that I think that you might like best.

* [Stress in Research](/tag/stress%20in%20research): A five-part
series trying to understand why research is so stressful,
and what we can do about it. These seem to be the posts that
were most well received.

* [Painfully Extended Metaphors](/tag/painfully%20extended%20metaphors):
Trying to make observations about research by metaphors
to other activites, like board games, music, gardening, and organized crime.
These posts are about as poetic as I can get.

Going beyond that, this has basically become a blog of advice for
researchers, PhD students, and faculty. The posts I like best, 
I have separated out into:

* [Advice for PhD Students](/tag/advice%20for%20phd%20students)
* [Advice for Professors](/tag/advice%20for%20professors)
* [Advice for Researchers](/tag/advice%20for%20researchers): 
Not specific to career stage. (For young and old alike!)

Alternately you can just go to:

* [All the Advice](/tag/advice): Don't say you weren't warned.

A final starting point is

* [The Silly Posts](/tag/silly): Some of these are my personal favorites, but they might not be yours.
